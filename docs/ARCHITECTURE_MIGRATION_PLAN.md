# NeuroVis Architecture Migration Plan

This document outlines the migration strategy from the current architecture to the new optimized scene structure for the NeuroVis educational platform.

## Migration Overview

The migration will follow a phased, incremental approach to ensure continuous functionality of the educational platform while transitioning to the more efficient architecture.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Educational Continuity**: Maintain all educational features throughout migration
2. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one system at a time to minimize risk
3. **Compatibility Layer**: Support both architectures during transition
4. **Testing Protocol**: Validate each migration step separately
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance improvements at each stage

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Services

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

1. Implement core service classes:
   - `SceneManager` for optimized scene handling
   - `StructureManager` for brain structure coordination
   - `UIComponentPool` for UI optimization

2. Create the optimized scene structure with placeholders
3. Implement `SystemIntegrationManager` to bridge old and new systems
4. Setup resource caching and optimization infrastructure

**Exit Criteria**: Services functional and accessible from legacy code

### Phase 2: Input and Interaction Systems

**Duration**: 1 week

1. Implement `InputRouter` for centralized input handling
2. Migrate camera control system to new architecture
3. Setup optimized selection system with compatibility layer
4. Implement essential interaction handlers

**Exit Criteria**: Basic interactions working in new architecture with feature parity

### Phase 3: Model and Visualization Systems

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

1. Migrate model loading and management
2. Implement optimized structure visualization
3. Setup highlighting and feedback systems
4. Migrate cross-section and annotation features

**Exit Criteria**: Full visualization capabilities with improved performance

### Phase 4: UI and Educational Features

**Duration**: 2 weeks

1. Implement optimized UI components
2. Migrate educational panels and information display
3. Setup comparison and relationship visualization
4. Implement educational pathway features

**Exit Criteria**: Complete educational UI with component pooling optimization

### Phase 5: Testing and Transition

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

1. Comprehensive testing of both architectures
2. Performance benchmarking and comparison
3. Final optimizations based on testing feedback
4. Full switchover to new architecture

**Exit Criteria**: New architecture fully operational with validated improvements

## System Migration Details

**Migration Steps**:
1. Setup optimized model organization in new scene structure
2. Implement resource sharing for materials and textures
3. Create adapter for legacy model loading requests
4. Maintain compatibility with existing model files
5. Add optimized model switching with visual transitions
6. Test with full model set in both systems
7. Migrate model visibility toggling functionality

### 4. Knowledge System Migration

**Legacy System**: `AnatomicalKnowledgeDatabase` / `KnowledgeService`  
**New System**: `StructureManager` with knowledge integration

**Migration Steps**:
1. Implement efficient caching in `StructureManager`
2. Maintain compatibility with both KB and KnowledgeService
3. Add enhanced relationship identification
4. Integrate with selection and visualization systems
5. Implement educational relationships between structures
6. Test with complete anatomical dataset
7. Validate all educational data is correctly accessible

### 5. UI System Migration

**Legacy System**: `InfoPanelFactory` / various panel implementations  
**New System**: `UIComponentPool` with optimized components

**Migration Steps**:
1. Create essential UI components in new architecture
2. Implement component pooling for performance
3. Create adapters for legacy panel creation
4. Setup theme consistency between systems
5. Add responsive layout for educational panels
6. Test with complex UI interactions
7. Measure and validate performance improvements

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Each migrated component will have dedicated unit tests:

```gdscript
# Test selection system migration
func test_structure_selection():
    # Test in legacy system
    var legacy_result = _test_legacy_selection("Hippocampus")
    
    # Test in new system
    var new_result = _test_new_selection("Hippocampus")
    
    # Validate same behavior
    assert_eq(legacy_result, new_result)
```

### Integration Testing

Testing the interaction between migrated and non-migrated components:

```gdscript
# Test structure selection affecting info panel display
func test_selection_panel_integration():
    # Select structure
    _select_structure("Thalamus")
    
    # Check panel content in both systems
    var legacy_content = _get_legacy_panel_content()
    var new_content = _get_new_panel_content()
    
    # Validate same educational information displayed
    assert_eq(legacy_content.title, new_content.title)
    assert_eq(legacy_content.description, new_content.description)
```

### Performance Testing

Benchmark key operations in both architectures:

1. **Startup Time**: Time to fully initialize scene
2. **Memory Usage**: RAM usage during educational workflows
3. **Frame Rate**: FPS during complex interactions
4. **Selection Speed**: Time to select structure and display info
5. **Scene Loading**: Time to transition between scenes

### Educational Feature Validation

Validate all educational features work correctly:

1. **Anatomical Information**: All structure data displays correctly
2. **Comparative Learning**: Multi-selection and comparison works
3. **Visualization Options**: All viewing modes function properly
4. **Educational UI**: All educational panels show correct information
5. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation work

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise during migration:

1. **System-Level Rollback**: Individual systems can roll back to legacy implementation
2. **Complete Rollback**: Return to legacy architecture if needed
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable new systems

## Post-Migration Optimization

After successful migration, implement these optimizations:

1. **Draw Call Reduction**: Further optimize material sharing
2. **GPU Instancing**: Use instancing for repeated structures
3. **Shader Optimization**: Optimize educational visual effects
4. **Memory Management**: Implement resource streaming for large datasets
5. **Animation Performance**: Optimize educational transitions

## Migration Progress Tracking

Track progress with these metrics:

1. **Systems Migrated**: Percentage of systems fully migrated
2. **Feature Parity**: Percentage of features working in new architecture
3. **Performance Delta**: Improvement in key performance indicators
4. **Code Quality**: Static analysis metrics of new vs. old code
5. **Educational Effectiveness**: User feedback on educational experience

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a clear path from the current architecture to the optimized scene structure while maintaining educational functionality and improving performance. The phased approach minimizes risk while allowing for incremental validation and optimization.
