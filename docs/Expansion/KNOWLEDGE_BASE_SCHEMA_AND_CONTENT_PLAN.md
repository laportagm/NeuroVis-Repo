# Knowledge Base Schema & Content Plan: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.2 (Refreshed)
**Date:** Thursday, May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

The core educational value of the AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer relies on accurate, well-structured, and accessible anatomical information. This document defines the schema (structure) for storing this information and outlines the plan for curating, verifying, and managing its content. This knowledge base will initially be a local file bundled with the application, forming the backbone of the information displayed to users.

## 2. Data Format (Initial)

- **Format:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Reasoning:**
  - Human-readable and relatively easy to edit manually for a solo developer.
  - Easily parsed by JavaScript (for the Electron + Three.js path) and GDScript (for the Godot Engine path).
  - Flexible enough to evolve the schema if needed in the future.
  - Avoids external database dependencies for the MVP, keeping the application self-contained and low-cost.
- **File Name (Example):** `anatomical_data.json`
- **Location:** To be stored in a project subfolder, e.g., `assets/data/`.

## 3. Detailed JSON Schema Definition

The root of the JSON file will be an array `[]` of objects `{}`, where each object represents a distinct anatomical structure.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "String",
    "displayName": "String",
    "alternativeNames": ["String"],
    "shortDescription": "String",
    "detailedDescription": "String",
    "functions": ["String"],
    "connections": [
      {
        "connectedStructureId": "String",
        "pathwayName": "String",
        "description": "String"
      }
    ],
    "clinicalNotes": "String",
    "imagePlaceholder": "String"
  }
  // ... more structure objects
]
```
````

**Field Explanations:**

- **`id` (String - REQUIRED):**
  - A unique identifier for the anatomical structure.
  - **Crucial:** This `id` MUST precisely match the name or a unique identifier of the corresponding selectable mesh(es) or node(s) in your 3D model(s). This is the key for linking 3D selection to data display.
  - Example: `"FrontalLobe_Mesh"`, `"Cerebellum_Main_Body"`, `"hippocampus_left_01"`.
- **`displayName` (String - REQUIRED):**
  - The common, human-readable name of the structure that will be displayed prominently in the UI.
  - Example: `"Frontal Lobe"`, `"Cerebellum"`, `"Left Hippocampus"`.
- **`alternativeNames` (Array of Strings - OPTIONAL):**
  - A list of synonyms, formal Latin names, or other common alternative names for the structure.
  - Useful for future search functionality or providing comprehensive information.
  - Example: `["Lobus frontalis", "Forelobe"]`.
- **`shortDescription` (String - REQUIRED for MVP):**
  - A concise summary (typically 1-3 sentences) of the structure, suitable for an initial overview display.
  - Should be easy to understand for the target audience.
- **`detailedDescription` (String - OPTIONAL for MVP, for future expansion):**
  - A more in-depth explanation of the structure, potentially including its subdivisions, histology (briefly), and more nuanced roles.
  - Could accommodate multiple paragraphs. Consider if basic Markdown formatting might be useful here for future rendering in UI (e.g., for bolding, italics, lists if your UI component can handle it).
- **`functions` (Array of Strings - REQUIRED for MVP):**
  - A list where each string describes a key function or role of the structure.
  - Aimed for display as a bulleted or numbered list in the UI.
  - Example: `["Higher-level cognitive processes", "Planning and decision-making", "Voluntary movement control"]`.
- **`connections` (Array of Objects - OPTIONAL for MVP, for future pathway visualization):**
  - Describes known anatomical or functional connections to other structures. Each object in the array represents one connection.
    - `connectedStructureId` (String): The `id` of another structure within this knowledge base.
    - `pathwayName` (String - Optional): The name of the specific neural tract or pathway involved (e.g., "Corticospinal Tract," "Fornix").
    - `description` (String - Optional): A brief description of this connection's role or nature.
- **`clinicalNotes` (String - OPTIONAL for MVP, for future expansion):**
  - Brief notes on the clinical relevance of the structure, common pathologies affecting it, or symptoms resulting from damage.
  - This section requires particularly careful and accurate sourcing.
- **`imagePlaceholder` (String - OPTIONAL, for future multimedia integration):**
  - A placeholder for a relative file path to a 2D image, diagram, or histological slide related to the structure, if you plan to add such visuals later.
  - Example: `"assets/images/diagrams/frontal_lobe_lateral_view.png"`.

## 4\. Example JSON Entries (Illustrative - Replace with your meticulously verified data)

]
```

## 5\. Content Curation Plan

- **Initial Structure List (MVP - Aim for 5-10 structures for Phase 2):**

  - This list should be driven by the distinct, easily selectable parts of your primary 3D model. Examples:
    1.  Frontal Lobe
    2.  Parietal Lobe
    3.  Temporal Lobe
    4.  Occipital Lobe
    5.  Cerebellum
    6.  Brainstem (or specific parts like Pons, Medulla if clearly modeled)
    7.  Hippocampus
    8.  Amygdala
    9.  Thalamus
    10. Basal Ganglia (or specific parts like Caudate, Putamen if clear)
  - **Action:** Review your chosen 3D model carefully. List its clearly defined, selectable mesh names/IDs that will map to the `id` field in your JSON.

- **Information Sources (CRITICAL - Ensure Accuracy and Reliability):**

  - **Primary Sources:** Reputable, peer-reviewed neuroanatomy textbooks (e.g., "Principles of Neural Science" by Kandel et al., "Gray's Anatomy for Students," "Netter's Atlas of Human Neuroscience").
  - **Secondary Sources:** Established medical school websites (e.g., neuroanatomy course materials from reputable universities), well-regarded neuroscience educational platforms (e.g., Kenhub, Radiopaedia for anatomical cross-referencing), and high-quality review articles from scientific journals.
  - **AI Assistants:** Can be used to _help find potential primary/secondary sources_ or to _draft initial summaries of information YOU provide from these sources_. **AI-generated factual content MUST NOT be used directly without meticulous verification and rewriting against authoritative human-expert sources.** AI is a research and drafting _assistant_, not the source of truth for medical facts.

- **Content Integrity & Intellectual Property Note:**

  - All factual anatomical descriptions and functional information must be synthesized and rewritten in your own words, drawing understanding from multiple authoritative sources.
  - Avoid direct copying of extensive copyrighted text. The goal is to provide accurate, educational summaries and explanations in a unique way for this application.
  - While general well-established anatomical facts are common knowledge, ensure the _expression_ of these facts is your own synthesis.

- **Verification Process:**

  1.  Draft information for a structure (name, description, functions, etc.).
  2.  Cross-reference every piece of information with at least two authoritative sources.
  3.  Prioritize information that is fundamental and commonly taught in introductory neuroanatomy.
  4.  Ensure consistency in terminology (e.g., use Terminologia Anatomica as a reference if needed for formal names).

- **Style Guide for Descriptions (Brief):**

  - **Language:** Clear, concise, precise, and accurate.
  - **Target Audience:** Primarily medical/neuroscience students, but aim for accessibility for an educated layperson where possible (especially for `shortDescription`).
  - **Jargon:** Use standard anatomical and physiological terms. If a complex term is unavoidable, consider if a brief parenthetical explanation or a future glossary feature would be beneficial.
  - **Tone:** Objective, educational, and informative.

## 6\. Data Storage and Access (Brief Overview)

- **Storage:** The `anatomical_data.json` file will be bundled with the application (e.g., within an `assets/data/` directory).
- **Access:** The application will load this JSON file into memory on startup (or as needed if it becomes extremely large in the future). Specific methods depend on the chosen framework (Electron/JavaScript or Godot/GDScript), as detailed in `DATA_STORAGE_AND_ACCESS_PLAN.md`.

## 7\. Schema Evolution Considerations

- The initial schema is designed to be extensible. New optional fields can be added later without breaking compatibility for entries that don't use them (e.g., adding a field for "Innervation" or "Blood Supply").
- If major structural changes are needed (e.g., deeply nested objects for subdivisions), this would require more careful data migration planning for future versions. For MVP, keep it as defined.
