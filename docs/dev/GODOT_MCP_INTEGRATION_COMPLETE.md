# Godot MCP Integration Summary

## What Was Set Up

I've successfully integrated Godot MCP functionality into your 11A-NeuroVis project. Here's what was created:

### Directory Structure

```

### Features Implemented

1. **Unified MCP Server** combining best features from both repositories:
   - CLI-based operations (no plugin required)
   - Full project control and automation
   - Intelligent error handling and feedback

2. **Comprehensive Tool Set**:
   - Editor control (launch, run, debug)
   - Scene management (create, modify, analyze)
   - Script operations (create with templates, read, update)
   - Project analysis (list files, get info)

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Works with existing project structure
   - Respects current file organization
   - Compatible with your debug tools

## Next Steps - User Actions Required

### 1. Install Dependencies (Required)
```bash
cd /Users/gagelaporta/11A-NeuroVis/godot-mcp
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Verify Godot Path (If Needed)
The default path is set to: `/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`

If your Godot is elsewhere, update:
- `godot-mcp/claude_desktop_config.json`
- `.vscode/godot-mcp.json`

### 3. Test the Integration (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/gagelaporta/11A-NeuroVis/godot-mcp
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop (Optional)
To use with Claude Desktop:
1. Copy the configuration from `godot-mcp/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Merge it into `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Restart Claude Desktop

## How to Use

Once set up, you can use natural language commands like:

- "Launch the Godot editor for my project"
- "List all scenes in my neurovisualization project"
- "Create a new scene for brain visualization with a Node3D root"
- "Add a MeshInstance3D node for the brain model"
- "Create a script for loading neuroscience data"
- "Run the project and show me any errors"

## What Makes This Integration Special

1. **No Plugin Required**: Uses Godot's CLI interface, so it works with any Godot 4.x project
2. **Project-Aware**: Automatically detects it's in your NeuroVis project
3. **Template Support**: Includes smart templates for common Godot node types
4. **Debug Capture**: Captures and returns console output when running projects
5. **Clean Integration**: Minimal changes to your existing project structure

## Troubleshooting

- **"Godot not found"**: Set the GODOT_PATH environment variable
- **"Permission denied"**: Run `chmod +x` on the shell scripts
- **Build errors**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- **"Cannot find module"**: Run the setup.sh script to install dependencies

## Files That Require No Changes

All your existing project files remain untouched:
- Your scenes in `/scenes`
- Your scripts in `/scripts`
- Your project.godot configuration
- All your existing debug tools and configurations

The MCP integration is completely additive and non-invasive.

---

The integration is now ready for use. Just run the setup script to install dependencies, and you'll be able to control Godot through natural language!
