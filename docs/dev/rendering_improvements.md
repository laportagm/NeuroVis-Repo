### Basic Integration Example

```gdscript
extends Node3D

# References to components
@onready var material_library = get_node("/root/MaterialLibrary")
@onready var lod_manager = get_node("/root/LODManager")
@onready var selection_visualizer = get_node("/root/SelectionVisualizer")
@onready var rendering_optimizer = get_node("/root/RenderingOptimizer")
@onready var medical_lighting = $MedicalLighting
@onready var medical_camera = $MedicalCameraController

func _ready():
    # Set up camera
    medical_camera.camera = $Camera3D
    medical_camera.apply_anatomical_view(medical_camera.AnatomicalView.ANTERIOR)
    
    # Load model
    var model = load("res://assets/models/brain_model.glb").instantiate()
    add_child(model)
    
    # Register with LOD system
    lod_manager.register_model(model, "BrainModel")
    
    # Apply optimization
    rendering_optimizer.optimize_model(model, "BrainModel")
    
    # Set up materials
    _apply_materials_to_model(model)

func _apply_materials_to_model(model):
    # Find all mesh instances
    var mesh_instances = []
    _find_mesh_instances(model, mesh_instances)
    
    # Apply materials based on mesh names
    for mesh in mesh_instances:
        material_library.apply_material_by_name_recognition(mesh)

    # Focus camera on structure
    medical_camera.focus_on_structure(mesh_instance, structure_name)
```

## Performance Recommendations

For optimal performance while maintaining educational visual quality:

1. **Balance LOD Settings**: Adjust LOD distance thresholds based on model complexity.
2. **Optimize Material Count**: Use `material_batching_enabled=true` with `material_similarity_threshold=0.9`.
3. **Lighting Quality**: Use `MedicalLighting.LightingPreset.EDUCATIONAL` for best balance of quality and performance.
4. **Occlusion Settings**: Set `occlusion_depth=3` for complex models, `occlusion_depth=2` for simpler models.
5. **Memory Management**: Use `LODManager.memory_strategy=1` (Balanced) for most scenarios.

### Target Performance Metrics

| Hardware Level | Target FPS | Recommended Settings |
|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Low-end | 30-45 FPS | quality_level=0, occlusion_culling=true, lod_enabled=true |
| Mid-range | 45-60 FPS | quality_level=1, occlusion_culling=true, lod_enabled=true |
| High-end | 60+ FPS | quality_level=2, occlusion_culling=true, lod_enabled=false |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Poor Performance**
- Check if optimizations are enabled: `RenderingOptimizer.frustum_culling_enabled` and `RenderingOptimizer.occlusion_culling_enabled`
- Verify LOD system is active: `LODManager.lod_enabled`
- Reduce material quality: `MaterialLibrary.quality_level = 1`

**Visual Artifacts**
- Material issues: Reset materials with `MaterialLibrary.apply_preset("educational")`
- LOD transition problems: Increase transition time with `LODManager.transition_time = 0.5`
- Selection glitches: Try `SelectionVisualizer.use_shader_selection = false`

**Memory Issues**
- Clear material cache: `MaterialLibrary._materials_cache.clear()`
- Reset LOD system: `LODManager.reset_to_highest_detail()`
- Check for memory leaks: Run `RenderingValidationTest.run_specific_test("cross_scene_stability")`

### Diagnostic Commands

Run these via Godot's debug console:

```
# Performance diagnostics
print(RenderingOptimizer.get_detailed_stats())

# Material system status
print(MaterialLibrary._materials_cache.size())

# LOD system status
print(LODManager._lod_models)
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future releases:

1. **Advanced Subsurface Scattering**: More accurate biological tissue rendering
2. **Dynamic Light Adaptation**: Automatic lighting adjustment based on structures being viewed
3. **Region-Based LOD**: Different LOD levels for different parts of complex models
4. **Raytraced Ambient Occlusion**: Higher quality ambient occlusion for superior depth perception
5. **GPU-Based Occlusion Culling**: Hardware-accelerated occlusion for better performance
6. **Educational Animation Presets**: Pre-configured camera movements for guided educational tours
