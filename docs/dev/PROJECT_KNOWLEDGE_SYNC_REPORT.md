### API Integration Points

#### AI Assistant API
```gdscript
# Ask educational question about current structure
AIAssistant.ask_about_current_structure("function")

# Set educational context for AI
AIAssistant.set_current_structure("hippocampus")

# Get service status
AIAssistant.get_service_status()
```

#### Knowledge Service API
```gdscript
# Get educational content for structure
var structure_data = KnowledgeService.get_structure("hippocampus")

# Search educational content
var results = KnowledgeService.search_structures("memory")
```

#### Component Registry API
```gdscript
# Create educational panel with configuration
var panel = ComponentRegistry.create_component("info_panel", {
    "structure_name": structure_name,
    "structure_data": structure_data,
    "theme": UIThemeManager.current_mode
})
```
