# Added Test Suites for NeuroVis

I've added several comprehensive test suites to help identify and fix issues in the NeuroVis application. All tests are integrated with the existing debug infrastructure and can be run from the debug scene.

## New Test Suites

### 1. UI Info Panel Test
- Verifies the UI info panel correctly displays structure information
- Tests panel visibility, close functionality, and structure data display
- Ensures proper integration with the knowledge base

### 2. Knowledge Base Test
- Validates JSON data loading and parsing
- Verifies structure retrieval and content validation
- Tests error handling for invalid data

### 3. Camera Controls Test
- Tests camera initialization and positioning
- Validates transform updates and zoom functionality
- Simulates user input for camera movement

### 4. Structure Selection Test
- Tests raycast selection of brain structures
- Verifies proper highlighting and UI updates
- Checks signal emission and info panel integration

## UI Improvements

- Added dedicated buttons in the debug scene to run each test individually
- Updated the "Run All Tests" functionality to include all test suites
- Improved test result display and error reporting

## How to Use the Tests

1. Run the debug scene:
   ```bash
   godot --path /Users/gagelaporta/A1-NeuroVis scenes/debug_scene.tscn
   ```

2. Use the buttons in the toolbar to run individual tests or all tests at once

3. View test results in the "Test Results" tab

These tests help ensure that all components of the application are working correctly and will make it easier to identify and fix issues during development.
