- Educational metadata included (functions, clinical relevance)
- Version 1.2 with 2025-05-25 update timestamp

**Critical Structures Verified**:
✅ Thalamus, Hippocampus, Amygdala, Striatum, Ventricles  
✅ Corpus Callosum, Brainstem, Cerebellum  
✅ Frontal/Temporal/Parietal/Occipital Lobes  
✅ Basal Ganglia components (Caudate, Putamen, Globus Pallidus)  
✅ Endocrine structures (Pituitary, Pineal)  

### 3. Enhanced Selection System

**Professional Selection Tolerances**: ✅ CONFIGURED

Small deep brain structures have enhanced selection tolerances for educational accessibility:

| Structure | Tolerance (pixels) | Medical Significance |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Pineal Gland | 25.0 | Circadian rhythm regulation |
| Pituitary Gland | 25.0 | Master endocrine gland |
| Subthalamic Nucleus | 22.0 | Parkinson's DBS target |
| Substantia Nigra | 22.0 | Dopamine production |
| Globus Pallidus | 20.0 | Movement regulation |

**Multi-ray Selection**: ✅ ACTIVE
- 9-ray sampling pattern for reliable small structure selection
- 8-pixel radius around click point for enhanced coverage
- Adaptive tolerance based on structure screen size

### 4. Structure Name Mapping

**Model → Knowledge Base Mapping**: ✅ WORKING

The system successfully maps 3D model structure names to knowledge base entries:

```
Model Structure Name → Knowledge Base Entry
─────────────────────────────────────────────
"Thalami (good)" → "Thalamus"
"Hipp and Others (good)" → "Hippocampus"  
"Striatum (good)" → "Striatum"
"Ventricles (good)" → "Ventricles"
"Corpus Callosum (good)" → "Corpus_Callosum"
"Brainstem (good) 1" → "Brainstem"
```
