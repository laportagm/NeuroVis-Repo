# NeuroVis AI Implementation Master Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a complete roadmap for AI-driven refactoring of the NeuroVis project, transforming a complex 1,200+ line main scene into a maintainable, component-based architecture.

### Key Objectives
1. **40% reduction** in main scene complexity
2. **25% improvement** in startup time  
3. **Zero** over-engineered error handling patterns
4. **80%** test coverage
5. **60fps** consistent performance

## Pre-Implementation Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
```bash
# Clone and prepare workspace
cd '/Users/gagelaporta/11A-NeuroVis copy3'
git checkout -b ai-refactoring-main
./quick_test.sh  # Baseline test

# Create refactoring structure
mkdir -p docs/refactoring/{before,after}
mkdir -p core/components
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,performance}
```

### 2. Baseline Metrics
```bash
claude "Capture baseline metrics: 1) Line count per file, 2) Startup time measurement, 3) Memory usage at load, 4) Current test coverage, 5) Performance profile. Save to docs/refactoring/before/metrics.json"
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Cleanup (Days 1-3)
**Goal:** Transform monolithic main scene into component architecture

#### Day 1: Component Extraction
```bash
# Morning Session
claude -p "Using main_scene_refactor_plan.md, create component base infrastructure. Execute tasks 1.1 and 1.2 from ai_prompts_phase1.md. Validate each component initialization."

# Afternoon Session  
claude -p "Extract BrainVisualizer component following task 2.1. Ensure all 3D functionality preserved. Run ./quick_test.sh after extraction."
```

#### Day 2: Complete Component System
```bash
# Parallel Implementation
claude -p "Execute tasks 2.2, 3.1, and 3.2 in parallel: Implement brain model loading, create UIManager, create InteractionHandler. Each component must be self-contained with clear API."
```

#### Day 3: Main Scene Simplification
```bash
# Final Integration
claude -p "Execute task 3.3: Refactor main scene to <200 lines. Coordinate components only. Then implement error_handling_cleanup.md to remove all defensive programming patterns."

# UI Simplification
claude -p "Execute ui_simplification_plan.md: Merge UI implementations, create standardized base, remove all fallback UI creation."
```

### Phase 2: Development Workflow (Days 4-5)

#### Day 4: Development Tools
```bash
# Morning: Re-enable Tools
claude -p "Following phase2_dev_workflow.md section 2.1, systematically re-enable all commented autoloads. Fix initialization issues. Create F12 dashboard."

# Afternoon: Code Style
claude -p "Execute section 2.2: Apply Godot style guide to entire codebase. Create style checker tool. Achieve zero violations."
```

#### Day 5: Documentation
```bash
claude -p "Execute section 2.3: Generate comprehensive API documentation for all public classes. Create architecture diagrams with Mermaid. Write development guide."
```

### Phase 3: Quality & Polish (Week 2-3)

#### Week 2: Testing and Performance
```bash
# Test Implementation
claude -p "Following phase3_quality_polish.md section 3.1, create test framework and comprehensive test suite. Target 80% coverage."

# Performance Optimization  
claude -p "Execute section 3.2: Profile performance, convert polling to events, implement LOD system. Achieve consistent 60fps."
```

#### Week 3: Polish
```bash
claude -p "Execute section 3.3: Implement full accessibility support, keyboard navigation, UI animations. Pass all accessibility checks."
```

## AI Execution Guidelines

### 1. Prompt Optimization Patterns
```bash
# Basic prompt - DON'T USE
claude "fix the error"

# Optimized prompt - USE THIS PATTERN
claude -p "Role: Senior GDScript developer. Context: NeuroVis node_3d.gd refactoring. Task: Extract brain visualization logic into BrainVisualizer component. Constraints: Maintain all functionality, use signals for communication, follow CLAUDE.md patterns. Validation: Run ./quick_test.sh. Output: Unified diff patches."
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Strategy
When tasks are independent, request parallel execution:
```xml
<parallel_tasks>
  <task>Create component base classes</task>
  <task>Set up test framework</task>
  <task>Generate documentation templates</task>
</parallel_tasks>
```

### 3. Validation Checkpoints
After each major change:
1. Run `./quick_test.sh`
2. Check for null reference errors
3. Verify UI functionality
4. Measure performance impact

### 4. Context Management
```bash
# Clear context between major phases
/clear

# Reference documentation for context
claude -p "Using CLAUDE.md conventions and main_scene_refactor_plan.md..."

# Store progress in scratchpad
claude "Create docs/refactoring/progress.md tracking completed tasks"
```

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Incremental Validation
- Never make large changes without testing
- Commit after each successful component extraction
- Maintain working state throughout

### 2. Documentation As You Go
- Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns
- Document API changes immediately
- Keep progress log updated

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Measure after each optimization
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Focus on user-visible improvements

## Post-Implementation

### 1. Final Metrics
```bash
claude "Compare metrics: before/metrics.json vs current state. Generate improvement report showing: code reduction %, performance gains, test coverage, error reduction."
```

### 2. Knowledge Transfer
```bash
claude "Create docs/refactoring/lessons_learned.md documenting: successful patterns, avoided pitfalls, reusable components, future recommendations."
```

### 3. Maintenance Guide
```bash
claude "Create docs/maintenance_guide.md with: component responsibilities, common issues/solutions, performance tuning tips, extension points."
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If Build Breaks
```bash
# Revert to last working state
git stash
git checkout main
./quick_test.sh

# Debug specific issue
claude -p "Debug build failure: [paste error]. Check scene dependencies, validate node paths, ensure proper initialization order."
```

### If Performance Degrades
```bash
claude "Profile performance regression: 1) Compare before/after metrics, 2) Identify slow operations, 3) Check for polling patterns, 4) Validate event connections."
```
