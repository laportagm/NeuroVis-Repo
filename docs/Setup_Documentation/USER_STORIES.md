# User Stories: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the user stories for the AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer. User stories help define the application's functionality from an end-user's perspective, ensuring development is focused on delivering value. They typically follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a benefit/goal]."

These stories will guide the incremental development of features, especially for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent iterations.

## 2. User Personas (Simplified)

To provide context for the user stories, we consider these primary personas:

- **Alex, the Medical Student:** Needs to learn and memorize complex neuroanatomy quickly and accurately for exams and clinical practice. Values intuitive visualization and clear, concise information.
- **Dr. Chen, the Neuroscience Researcher:** Explores specific brain regions and their connections for research purposes. Values accuracy, detail, and the ability to quickly access functional information.
- **Sam, the Curious Learner:** Has a general interest in understanding the brain. Values engaging content and easy-to-understand explanations without overwhelming jargon.

## 3. User Stories for "Must-Have" (MVP) Features

_(These stories correspond to the "Must-Have" features M1-M9 outlined in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and will be tackled incrementally across the initial development phases.)_

---

## **M1: Load and display at least one detailed 3D brain model.**

- **US1.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the application to launch and immediately display a clear, well-rendered 3D model of the human brain so that I can begin exploring without delay.
- **US1.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want to see a visually appealing 3D brain model when I open the application so that I feel engaged and interested to learn more.

---

## **M2: Standard 3D navigation controls (orbit, zoom, pan) via mouse.**

- **US2.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to easily rotate the 3D brain model in any direction using my mouse (e.g., left-click and drag) so that I can examine structures from all angles.
- **US2.2:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want to zoom in and out of the 3D brain model smoothly using my mouse scroll wheel so that I can inspect fine details or get a broader overview.
- **US2.3:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to pan the 3D brain model (move it side-to-side, up-and-down) using my mouse (e.g., right-click/middle-click and drag) so that I can focus the view on different areas of interest.

---

## **M3: Click-to-select distinct anatomical structures within the 3D model.**

- **US3.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to be able to click on a visible part of the 3D brain model, like the cerebellum, so that the application recognizes I am interested in that specific structure.
- **US3.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want a simple way, like clicking, to indicate to the application which part of the brain I want to learn about.

---

## **M4: Visual highlighting of the selected structure.**

- **US4.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the brain structure I click on to visually change (e.g., change color or glow) so that I have clear, immediate feedback confirming my selection.
- **US4.2:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want the selected structure to be distinctly highlighted so I can easily differentiate it from surrounding structures while I examine it.

---

## **M5: Display basic information (name, short description, key functions) for selected structures from a local data source.**

- **US5.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), when I select a brain structure, I want to immediately see its correct anatomical name displayed clearly so I can learn and verify terminology.
- **US5.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), after selecting a brain part, I want to read a short, easy-to-understand description of what it is so I can grasp its basic identity.
- **US5.3:** As Alex (Medical Student), upon selecting a structure, I want to see a concise list of its key functions so that I can quickly associate the structure with its physiological roles.

---

## **M6: Simple User Interface (UI) for displaying information and potentially AI interaction.**

- **US6.1:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want the information about a selected brain part to appear in a dedicated, easy-to-read area of the screen so I don't have to search for it.
- **US6.2:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the UI to be clean and uncluttered so that I can focus on the 3D model and the anatomical information without distractions.

---

## **M7: In-app AI assistant (via online free-tier API) for answering questions and providing dynamic explanations.**

- **US7.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), when a structure is selected, I want to be able to ask the in-app AI assistant a specific question like "What are the main neurotransmitters associated with the hippocampus?" so I can get a targeted answer.
- **US7.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), after selecting a brain part, I want the AI assistant to offer a slightly more detailed or alternative explanation of its function in simple terms, beyond the basic description.
- **US7.3:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want to ask the AI assistant clarifying questions about a selected structure's role or known research findings so I can quickly get supplementary information.

---

## **M8 & M9: Cross-platform support (Windows and macOS) & Distributable Installer.**

- **US8.1 (Developer-focused):** As the developer, I want the application to be buildable for both Windows and macOS from my Mac development environment so that a wider audience can use it.
- **US9.1 (User-focused):** As Alex (Medical Student) using a Windows PC, I want to be able to download an installer and easily set up the Brain Anatomy Visualizer on my computer.
- **US9.2 (User-focused):** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher) using a MacBook, I want a simple way to download and install the application (e.g., a DMG file).

## 4. User Stories for "Nice-to-Have" Features (Examples)

- **N1.1:** As Dr. Chen, I want to be able to load a specialized 3D model of a specific brain region (e.g., brainstem) if available, so I can focus my research.
- **N2.1:** As Alex, I want to be able to place temporary labels or pins on the 3D model while studying, so I can mark structures for later review.
- **N3.1:** As a medical student, I want to see major neural pathways (like the corticospinal tract) visualized on the 3D model when I select relevant structures, so I can understand connectivity.
- **N6.1:** As Sam, I want to be able to ask the AI assistant questions using my voice, so the interaction feels more natural.

## 5. Backlog Management Note

This document will serve as an initial backlog. Stories will be prioritized based on the phased development plan. As development progresses, stories might be refined, broken down further, or new ones added based on insights and feedback.
