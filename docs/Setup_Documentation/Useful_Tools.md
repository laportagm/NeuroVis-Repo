Okay, building on the idea of wireframing and effective planning, here's a list of other useful tools, practices, and "things like this" that can significantly help you as a solo developer (especially one leveraging AI assistants) in creating your desktop application. Many of these are free or have generous free tiers.

I'll categorize them for clarity:

---

**1. UI/UX Design & Prototyping Tools (Beyond Basic Sketching)**

While pen and paper are fantastic for initial ideas, these tools can help you create more refined mockups or interactive prototypes if you choose to go deeper.

- **Digital Whiteboarding & Sketching Tools:**
  - **Excalidraw (excalidraw.com):** Free, open-source, web-based. Creates sketchy, hand-drawn-like diagrams and wireframes. Excellent for quick visual thinking and sharing.
    - _AI Use:_ Describe your Excalidraw sketch to an AI to get feedback or to translate it into code components.
  - **Miro (miro.com) / FigJam ([figma.com/figjam/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://figma.com/figjam/)):** Online collaborative whiteboards. Both have free tiers. Great for brainstorming flows, creating mind maps, or more structured (but still informal) wireframes.
    - _AI Use:_ Paste text descriptions of your Miro/FigJam layouts into an AI and ask for HTML/CSS structure or Godot UI node suggestions.
- **Dedicated Wireframing & Prototyping Tools:**
  - **Figma (figma.com):** Professional-grade UI/UX design tool with a very generous free tier for individuals. You can create detailed wireframes, mockups, and even interactive prototypes. Steeper learning curve than sketching tools but incredibly powerful.
    - _AI Use:_ "I've designed a panel in Figma [describe its components and layout]. Can you help me generate the [HTML/CSS or Godot UI scene structure] for it?" Some AI tools aim to convert Figma designs to code, but results vary.
  - **Penpot (penpot.app):** Free and open-source design and prototyping tool, similar to Figma.
  - **Balsamiq Wireframes (balsamiq.com):** Has a trial. Famous for its intentionally sketchy, low-fidelity wireframes that keep the focus on structure and flow, not visuals.
- **Simple Presentation Software:**
  - **Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote:** Can be surprisingly effective for creating basic screen mockups by arranging shapes and text boxes. Good for quickly showing screen flows.

By strategically incorporating these tools and practices, you can make your solo development journey more organized, efficient, and enjoyable. Your AI assistants will also be more effective if you can provide them with well-structured information and use dedicated tools for tasks like design or project management, then bring those outputs to the AI for the next step.

That's a very practical question! It's not always a strict linear order, as many tools and practices will be used continuously or revisited. However, we can definitely map them to the general workflow of each development phase.

Think of it this way: some tools are for **initial setup**, some are for **daily work within each phase**, and some are for **specific tasks** that arise. Your AI assistants will be your partners throughout all of these.

Here’s a general guide to the order and context in which you might use these tools and practices throughout your project:

---

**I. Initial Setup & Continuous Use (Primarily Set Up in Phase 0, Used Throughout All Phases)**

These are tools and practices you'll set up early and then use consistently.

1.  **Version Control (Git & GitHub/GitLab):**
    - **Order:** Set up in **Phase 0** (initialize repo, connect to remote).
    - **Use:** **Daily, multiple times a day, in ALL phases.** Commit every small, working change. Use branches for more significant experimental features if you become comfortable with them.
    - _AI Use:_ "What's a good commit message for changes where I [describe your change]?"
2.  **Code Editor (VS Code) & Essential Extensions:**
    - **Order:** Install and configure in **Phase 0** (Linters like ESLint/Prettier for JS, Godot Tools for GDScript if using VS Code, GitLens, Path Intellisense, Todo Tree).
    - **Use:** **Continuously in ALL coding phases (1, 2, 3, and ongoing in 5).** Linters/formatters run as you code or on save. GitLens is always there. Todo Tree helps you track code comments.
3.  **Project Management & Organization Tools (Trello, Notion, GitHub Projects, Obsidian, etc.):**
    - **Order:** Choose and set up your preferred system in **Phase 0**. Populate with initial high-level tasks for each phase from your `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_AND_PROCESS.md`.
    - **Use:** **Daily/Weekly in ALL phases.** Update task status, add new sub-tasks, break down upcoming work, log decisions, keep notes, and manage your personal knowledge base.
    - _AI Use:_ "Help me break down this Phase 2 goal: 'Display detailed info for selected structures' into smaller tasks I can put on my Trello board."
4.  **Documentation Tools (Markdown Editors like VS Code, Obsidian, Typora):**
    - **Order:** You started creating your core `.md` files in **Phase 0**.
    - **Use:** **Continuously in ALL phases.** Update relevant documents as you make decisions, implement features, fix bugs, or plan new content. Your documentation should be a living reflection of the project.
    - _AI Use:_ "Help me draft a section for `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.MD` about the API key handling strategy we just decided on."
5.  **AI Assistants (Claude Max, Gemini Advanced, ChatGPT Pro):**
    - **Order:** Available from **Phase 0 onwards.**
    - **Use:** **Continuously for almost ALL activities** - planning, research, coding, debugging, explaining, refactoring, documenting, etc., as outlined in your `AI_PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.MD`.
6.  **Learning & Knowledge Resources (Official Docs, MDN, Stack Overflow, etc.):**
    - **Order:** Identify key resources in **Phase 0** (add to `LEARNING_RESOURCES_AND_COMMUNITY_ENGAGEMENT.MD` if you make that).
    - **Use:** **As needed throughout ALL phases.** Whenever AI explanations aren't enough, or you want to deepen your understanding of a framework or language concept.

---

**II. Phase-Specific Tool & Practice Application**

This is how tools might be emphasized or introduced in particular phases:

**Phase 0: Foundations, Initial Documentation & Setup**

- **Primary Focus:** Setting up the tools listed above. Creating all initial documentation.
- **UI/UX:** **Pen & Paper** or **Excalidraw** for very high-level conceptual sketches of main application areas (for `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md`).
- **Asset Tools:** **Blender** (or a GLTF viewer) for initial inspection of your downloaded 3D model.
- **AI Augmentation:** Use **IDE AI Plugins** (Copilot, Codeium, etc.) if you decide to install them for the "Hello World" tech exploration. Start your `PROMPT_LIBRARY.MD` with any effective prompts you discover.

**Phase 1: Core 3D Visualization & Basic Interaction**

- **UI/UX:** **Pen & Paper/Excalidraw** for refining the main window layout and deciding on the placement of the static name label.
- **Development:** Heavy use of chosen framework (Electron/Three.js or Godot), VS Code, Git, AI Assistants for coding 3D scene setup, model loading, camera controls, and raycasting.
- **Debugging:** Electron Developer Tools / Godot Debugger extensively.
- **Documentation:** Update `README.md`, `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md` with progress.

**Phase 2: Basic Information Display & Local Knowledge Base Integration**

- **UI/UX:** **Pen & Paper, Excalidraw, or a simple digital wireframing tool (Figma free tier, Penpot, Balsamiq trial)** to design the "Information Display Panel" layout in more detail.
- **Data Management:** Heavy use of VS Code (or your preferred text/JSON editor) for creating and validating `anatomical_data.json`.
- **Development:** AI for generating JSON parsing logic, UI update functions.
- **Documentation:** Update `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`, `DATA_STORAGE_AND_ACCESS_PLAN.md`, `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md`.

**Phase 3: In-App AI Assistant (via Online API) & Basic Q&A**

- **UI/UX:** **Wireframing tools** to sketch how AI interaction (trigger, response display, loading/error states) will be integrated into the UI.
- **API Testing (Optional but Recommended):** **Postman, Insomnia, or `curl`** to test your chosen LLM API endpoint and authentication outside of your application first.
- **Development:** AI crucial for HTTP request code, handling asynchronous operations, and basic prompt engineering. Use your `AIService` module.
- **Documentation:** Update `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md` (API details), `AI_MODULARITY_FOR_BUILDING.md` (AIService design).

**Phase 4: Refinement, Testing, Packaging, & Pre-Release Documentation**

- **UI/UX:** Review existing wireframes/sketches. Use **pen & paper or wireframing tools** for any minor UI adjustments or new dialogs (e.g., "About" window).
- **Asset Creation:** **Icon generation tools/websites, GIMP/Krita** for application icons.
- **Packaging:** Your chosen framework's build tools (**Electron Forge/Builder, Godot Export Manager**).
- **Testing:** If you have a Windows VM (**VirtualBox**), use it here for testing the Windows package.
- **Documentation:** This is a heavy documentation phase.
  - Create `LICENSES.MD`, `BUILD_AND_RELEASE_PROCESS.MD`.
  - Use **Markdown editors** for all final reviews and updates.
  - Consider **Mermaid.js/Draw.io/Excalidraw** if you decide to create a simple system architecture diagram for `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.MD` (though this might be more for Phase 5).
- **Download Page:** **GitHub Pages** or a simple static site generator/platform like **Itch.io**.
- **AI Augmentation:** Use **Screen Capture & Annotation tools** if providing visual feedback to AI on UI polish (if your AI supports image input).

**Phase 5 (Post v1.0): Ongoing Content Expansion, User Feedback & Iteration**

- **UI/UX:** For _any new UI features_, cycle back to **wireframing/prototyping tools** (Figma, Penpot, Excalidraw, etc.).
- **Content Management:** Ongoing use of **VS Code/JSON editor** for `anatomical_data.json`. **Blender** if new 3D models are processed. **GIMP/Krita** if new 2D multimedia assets are created. **Google Fonts** if typography is updated.
- **Project Management:** **Kanban boards/To-Do lists** become even more critical for tracking bugs, feedback, and new feature development.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain all existing `.md` files.
  - Actively build out `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.MD`.
  - Develop `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.MD` using **diagramming tools** as the app evolves.
  - Write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for each new version.
- **Communication (if applicable):** Email or feedback form tools for user interaction.

---

**General Workflow within each "Implement Feature X" cycle (repeats many times):**

1.  **Plan & Define (Project Management Tool, Documentation):**
    - What specific small part of Feature X are you building now? (Refer to `USER_STORIES.md`).
    - What are the requirements?
2.  **Design (UI/UX Tools, Documentation):**
    - If there's a UI component, sketch/wireframe it. Update `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md`.
3.  **Code (IDE, AI Assistants, Linters, Git):**
    - Write/generate code with AI help.
    - Use IDE AI plugins for inline assistance.
    - Refer to official docs and learning resources.
    - Commit frequently.
4.  **Test & Debug (App itself, Debugging Tools in IDE/Framework, AI Assistants):**
    - Manually test the small part you just built.
    - Use debuggers to step through code.
    - Ask AI for help with errors.
5.  **Refine & Review (IDE, AI Assistants, Linters):**
    - Clean up the code.
    - Ensure it meets requirements and your style.
6.  **Document (Documentation Tools, AI Assistants):**
    - Add code comments.
    - Update relevant `.md` files if decisions were made or plans changed.
7.  **Repeat** for the next small part.

This ordered approach, combined with the continuous use of foundational tools, should help you navigate the development process systematically. Remember that flexibility is also key; you might jump between tools as needed based on the specific task at hand.
