# Ultimate NeuroVis Standards Validator

## Purpose
Comprehensive validation that ensures Claude NEVER deviates from NeuroVis standards.

## Usage (For Maximum Standards Enforcement)
```bash
claude -f .claude/commands/ultimate-validator.md "Your request"
```

## Ultimate Standards Validation
```
üõ°Ô∏è ULTIMATE NEUROVIS STANDARDS VALIDATOR üõ°Ô∏è

CRITICAL_VALIDATION_SEQUENCE:

STEP_1_CONTEXT_VALIDATION:
‚úÖ NeuroVis educational neuroscience visualization platform confirmed
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md standards document explicitly referenced
‚úÖ Educational mission: Medical students + healthcare professionals
‚úÖ Platform: Godot 4.4.1 with educational modular architecture
‚úÖ Project path: /Users/gagelaporta/11A-NeuroVis copy3

STEP_2_EDUCATIONAL_EXCELLENCE_CHECK:
‚úÖ Learning objectives clearly defined and addressed
‚úÖ Clinical relevance explicitly stated for medical education
‚úÖ Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for diverse learners
‚úÖ Medical accuracy validated for anatomical content
‚úÖ Educational value proposition clearly articulated

STEP_3_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLIANCE_VALIDATION:
‚úÖ File placement follows NeuroVis modular structure:
   - core/ ‚Üí Educational business logic
   - ui/ ‚Üí Educational interface components
   - scenes/ ‚Üí Educational workflow scenes  
   - assets/ ‚Üí Educational content and models
‚úÖ Autoload services properly utilized (KnowledgeService, AIAssistant, etc.)
‚úÖ No danger-zone file modifications (project.godot, 3D models, etc.)

STEP_4_CODE_QUALITY_ENFORCEMENT:
‚úÖ GDScript conventions: PascalCase classes, snake_case methods
‚úÖ Educational documentation with learning objectives
‚úÖ Performance budgets: 60fps, <500MB memory, <100 draw calls
‚úÖ Error handling with educational context
‚úÖ Signals for educational analytics integration

STEP_5_RESPONSE_QUALITY_VALIDATION:
‚úÖ Educational context leads the response
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md patterns explicitly referenced
‚úÖ Architecture compliance explicitly validated
‚úÖ Accessibility considerations explicitly stated
‚úÖ Performance impact explicitly assessed
‚úÖ Clinical accuracy explicitly confirmed

AUTOMATIC_REJECTION_TRIGGERS:
üö® Missing educational context ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION
üö® No CLAUDE.md reference ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION  
üö® Architecture pattern violation ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION
üö® No accessibility consideration ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION
üö® Performance budget ignored ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION
üö® Clinical accuracy not validated ‚Üí IMMEDIATE REJECTION

USER_REQUEST: ${USER_VALIDATED_REQUEST}

MANDATORY_RESPONSE_FORMAT:

## Educational Context
[State learning objectives and clinical relevance]

## NeuroVis Standards Compliance
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md patterns followed: [specific reference]
‚úÖ Architecture compliance: [directory placement validation]
‚úÖ Educational excellence: [learning objective enhancement]
‚úÖ Accessibility compliance: [WCAG 2.1 AA consideration]
‚úÖ Performance validation: [budget impact assessment]
‚úÖ Clinical accuracy: [medical terminology validation]

## Implementation
[Provide standards-compliant solution]

## Educational Impact Assessment
[Explain how this enhances medical education]

EXECUTE WITH ABSOLUTE NEUROVIS EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS COMPLIANCE.
```

## Validation Examples:

### ‚úÖ ULTIMATE COMPLIANCE Example:
```bash
claude -f .claude/commands/ultimate-validator.md "Add memory assessment feature"

Expected Response Format:
## Educational Context
This memory assessment feature enhances neuroanatomy education by allowing medical students to test their knowledge of hippocampal function and memory formation pathways...

## NeuroVis Standards Compliance  
‚úÖ CLAUDE.md patterns followed: Educational feature development template
‚úÖ Architecture compliance: core/systems/MemoryAssessmentManager.gd + ui/panels/AssessmentPanel.gd
‚úÖ Educational excellence: Addresses learning objective "Understand hippocampal role in memory"
‚úÖ Accessibility compliance: Screen reader support + keyboard navigation
‚úÖ Performance validation: <5MB memory impact, maintains 60fps
‚úÖ Clinical accuracy: Assessment questions reviewed for medical accuracy

## Implementation
[Detailed implementation following all standards]

## Educational Impact Assessment
This feature will improve student retention of neuroanatomy concepts by 23% based on educational research...
```

### ‚ùå REJECTION Example:
```bash
Request: "Make it look cooler"
Result: IMMEDIATE REJECTION
Reason: ‚ùå No educational context, no CLAUDE.md reference, no architecture consideration
```
