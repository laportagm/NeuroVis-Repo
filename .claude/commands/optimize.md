# NeuroVis Code Optimization System

**Purpose**: Advanced code optimization for NeuroVis educational platform using comprehensive MCP integration to enhance performance while maintaining educational excellence.

**MCPs Used**: `sequential-thinking`, `memory`, `filesystem`, `sqlite`, `godot-mcp`

## MCP-Enhanced Optimization Request

Please analyze the following educational code and provide optimization recommendations using our MCP-enhanced workflow:

### Step 1: Code Analysis Preparation
**Use MCP `filesystem`** to read related educational components
**Use MCP `memory`** to retrieve optimization patterns for educational features
**Use MCP `sequential-thinking`** for systematic performance analysis

### Step 2: Educational Performance Analysis

**Code to Optimize**: [Paste your GDScript code here]

**Educational Context**:
- Which educational feature does this code support?
- What learning objectives are impacted?
- Are there accessibility or clinical accuracy requirements?
- Performance targets: 60fps, <500MB memory, <100 draw calls

### Step 3: MCP-Enhanced Optimization Process

1. **Systematic Analysis** (using MCP `sequential-thinking`):
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Analyze educational functionality impact
   - Consider maintenance and readability for educational platform

2. **Pattern Recognition** (using MCP `memory`):
   - Search for similar educational optimization patterns
   - Retrieve best practices for educational 3D rendering
   - Compare with educational performance standards

3. **Technical Optimization** (using MCP `godot-mcp` + `filesystem`):
   - Godot-specific performance improvements
   - Educational scene structure optimization
   - Memory management for complex anatomical models

4. **Knowledge Storage** (using MCP `sqlite` + `memory`):
   - Log optimization results for educational reference
   - Store patterns for future educational development
   - Track performance improvements over time

### Step 4: Optimization Requirements

Please provide:

1. **Three Specific Optimizations** with:
   - Performance improvement estimate
   - Educational functionality preservation
   - Code maintainability assessment
   - Implementation difficulty level

2. **Educational Impact Analysis**:
   - Learning experience improvements
   - Accessibility enhancements
   - Clinical accuracy preservation

3. **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Step-by-step refactoring approach
   - Testing strategy for educational features
   - Rollback plan if needed

### Educational Quality Standards

Ensure optimizations:
- ✅ Maintain educational functionality and learning objectives
- ✅ Preserve accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Keep clinical accuracy and medical terminology
- ✅ Follow NeuroVis architectural patterns
- ✅ Include proper educational documentation
- ✅ Meet performance targets for educational experience

**Focus**: Educational platform performance + learning continuity + technical excellence
