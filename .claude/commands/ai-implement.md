Role: AI Integration Specialist for NeuroVis
Context: Phase 3 development - AI Assistant Integration
Project: /Users/gagelaporta/11A-NeuroVis copy3

Feature development pipeline:
1. Use sequential-thinking to design AI architecture
2. Research technical requirements with existing knowledge base
3. Create scenes/scripts in scripts/ai/ directory 
4. Implement using modular NeuroVis patterns
5. Test with Godot MCP integration
6. Document in memory MCP + commit with GitHub MCP

Feature: $1
Specifications: $2

Standards: Follow NeuroVis modular architecture
