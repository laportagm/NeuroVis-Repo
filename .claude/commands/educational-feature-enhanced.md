# Command: Enhanced Educational Feature Development

**Purpose**: Complete educational feature development pipeline for NeuroVis platform using comprehensive MCP integration.

**MCPs Used**: `sequential-thinking`, `memory`, `filesystem`, `sqlite`, `godot-mcp`, `github`

## Overview
This command provides a complete workflow for developing educational features in the NeuroVis platform, ensuring educational excellence, code quality, and proper integration with existing systems.

## Development Pipeline

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis & Planning
1. **Use MCP `sequential-thinking`** to systematically analyze the educational feature requirements
2. **Use MCP `memory`** to:
   - Search for similar existing educational patterns
   - Store new feature requirements and design decisions
   - Create relationships between educational concepts
3. **Use MCP `sqlite`** to log feature development progress and educational objectives

### Phase 2: Educational Context Analysis
1. **Analyze educational objectives**:
   - Learning outcomes for target audience (medical students, researchers, professionals)
   - Clinical relevance and pathology connections
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements
   - Integration with existing educational workflows

2. **Use MCP `memory`** to:
   - Create entities for educational concepts being implemented
   - Establish relationships with existing anatomical knowledge
   - Store learning pathway connections

### Phase 3: Technical Implementation
1. **Use MCP `filesystem`** to:
   - Read existing educational component patterns
   - Analyze current educational architecture in `core/education/`
   - Review educational UI components in `ui/components/`

2. **Use MCP `godot-mcp`** to:
   - Create educational scenes with proper node structure
   - Add educational interaction components
   - Configure educational materials and shaders

3. **Follow NeuroVis standards**:
   - Educational naming conventions (PascalCase classes, snake_case functions)
   - Proper documentation with learning objectives
   - Error handling with educational context
   - Performance targets (60fps, <3s loading)

### Phase 4: Educational Content Integration
1. **Knowledge Base Integration**:
   - Add educational content to `assets/data/anatomical_data.json`
   - Include `educationalLevel`, `learningObjectives`, `clinicalRelevance`
   - Ensure medical terminology accuracy

2. **Use MCP `memory`** to:
   - Store educational content relationships
   - Track learning progression dependencies
   - Maintain clinical accuracy metadata

### Phase 5: UI/UX Educational Design
1. **Theme Integration**:
   - Support both Enhanced (student-friendly) and Minimal (clinical) themes
   - Use `UIThemeManager` for consistent theming
   - Implement accessibility features (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)

2. **Use MCP `filesystem`** to:
   - Read existing educational panel patterns
   - Update educational component library
   - Maintain UI consistency standards

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
1. **Educational Testing**:
   - Create tests in `tests/integration/` for educational workflows
   - Validate learning objectives achievement
   - Test accessibility compliance
   - Verify clinical accuracy

2. **Use MCP `sqlite`** to:
   - Log test results and educational metrics
   - Track performance against educational targets
   - Store validation outcomes

### Phase 7: Documentation & Integration
1. **Use MCP `github`** to:
   - Create feature branch following educational naming conventions
   - Commit with proper educational context
   - Create pull request with educational validation checklist

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Add feature to `docs/EDUCATIONAL_MODULARITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Update architectural documentation
   - Include learning objective documentation

## MCP Integration Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize feature development
memory.create_entities([{
  "name": "FeatureName",
  "entityType": "educational_feature",
  "observations": ["Learning objectives", "Target audience", "Clinical relevance"]
}])

# 2. Analyze existing patterns
filesystem.search_files("core/education/", "*.gd")
memory.search_nodes("educational patterns")

# 3. Create implementation
godot-mcp.create_scene("scenes/education/", "feature_scene.tscn")
filesystem.write_file("core/education/FeatureName.gd", "implementation")

# 4. Validate and test
sqlite.append_insight("Educational feature validation results")

# 5. Document and integrate
github.create_pull_request("Educational Feature: FeatureName")
```

## Output Format
