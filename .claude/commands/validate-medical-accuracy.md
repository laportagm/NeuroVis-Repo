# Command: Validate Medical Accuracy

**Purpose**: Ensure comprehensive medical accuracy across all NeuroVis educational content through systematic validation using multiple medical databases, expert review processes, and AI-assisted verification.

**MCPs Used**: `fetch` (primary), `memory`, `sequential-thinking`, `filesystem`, `sqlite`

## Overview
This command provides a comprehensive medical accuracy validation system for NeuroVis educational content, ensuring anatomical correctness, clinical relevance, and pathological accuracy for medical education standards.

## Medical Accuracy Validation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Content Inventory & Analysis
**Use MCP `sequential-thinking`** to systematically analyze validation requirements:
- Identify all educational content requiring medical validation
- Categorize content by medical complexity and clinical importance
- Prioritize validation based on educational impact and usage frequency
- Establish validation criteria for different content types

**Use MCP `filesystem`** to:
- Scan `assets/data/anatomical_data.json` for medical content
- Analyze educational component documentation
- Review clinical relevance statements
- Inventory pathology descriptions and medical terminology

**Use MCP `memory`** to:
- Create medical concept entities for validation tracking
- Establish relationships between anatomical structures and clinical conditions
- Store validation criteria and medical accuracy standards
- Maintain expert reviewer information and specializations

### Phase 2: External Medical Database Validation
**Use MCP `fetch`** to access authoritative medical sources:
- **PubMed/NCBI**: Validate anatomical terminology and recent research
- **Gray's Anatomy**: Cross-reference anatomical descriptions and relationships
- **Human Brain Atlas**: Verify spatial relationships and structural boundaries
- **Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)**: Validate medical terminology consistency
- **WHO ICD-11**: Verify pathology classifications and diagnostic criteria

**Medical Database Validation Workflow**:
```bash
# Validate anatomical terminology
fetch("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/", {
  "query": "anatomical_term",
  "validation_type": "terminology"
})

# Cross-reference pathology information
fetch("https://icd.who.int/browse11/", {
  "query": "pathology_description",
  "validation_type": "clinical_accuracy"
})

# Verify research currency
fetch("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/", {
  "query": "neuroanatomy recent_research",
  "validation_type": "current_knowledge"
})
```

**Use MCP `memory`** to:
- Store validation results from external databases
- Create relationships between validated content and authoritative sources
- Maintain validation timestamps and source citations
- Track validation confidence levels and expert consensus

### Phase 3: Clinical Relevance Validation
**Use MCP `sequential-thinking`** to analyze clinical accuracy:
- Evaluate pathology descriptions for medical accuracy
- Assess clinical case relevance and educational value
- Validate treatment information and diagnostic criteria
- Review medical imaging correlations and anatomical presentations

**Clinical Validation Criteria**:
- **Anatomical Accuracy**: Spatial relationships, structural boundaries, developmental variations
- **Pathological Accuracy**: Disease presentations, diagnostic criteria, treatment options
- **Clinical Relevance**: Real-world medical applications, case study accuracy
- **Terminology Consistency**: Standard medical terminology, international nomenclature
- **Research Currency**: Current medical knowledge, recent research findings

**Use MCP `sqlite`** to:
- Log clinical validation results and expert review feedback
- Track validation status for all educational content
- Store medical accuracy metrics and confidence scores
- Maintain audit trail for medical content changes

### Phase 4: Expert Medical Review Process
**Medical Expert Review Workflow**:
- **Neuroanatomist Review**: Structural accuracy and spatial relationships
- **Neurologist Review**: Clinical relevance and pathological accuracy
- **Medical Educator Review**: Educational effectiveness and learning objectives
- **Accessibility Expert Review**: Inclusive design and diverse learning needs

**Use MCP `memory`** to:
- Store expert reviewer profiles and specializations
- Track review assignments and completion status
- Maintain expert feedback and validation recommendations
- Create relationships between content and expert approval

**Expert Review Documentation**:
```gdscript
# Medical Expert Review Record
{
  "content_id": "hippocampus_educational_module",
  "reviewer_type": "neuroanatomist",
  "reviewer_credentials": "MD, PhD Neuroanatomy",
  "review_date": "2024-12-07",
  "accuracy_rating": 9.5,
  "clinical_relevance": 9.0,
  "educational_value": 8.5,
  "recommendations": [
    "Update terminology to latest anatomical nomenclature",
    "Add developmental variation information",
    "Include recent research on memory formation"
  ],
  "approval_status": "approved_with_modifications"
}
```

### Phase 5: Automated Validation Tools
**Use MCP `fetch`** to implement automated validation:
- **Medical Terminology Validation**: Cross-reference against standard medical dictionaries
- **Anatomical Relationship Validation**: Verify spatial and functional relationships
- **Citation Verification**: Validate academic and medical source citations
- **Image Accuracy Validation**: Cross-reference 3D models with medical atlases

**Automated Validation Tools**:
```bash
# Terminology validation
fetch("medical_terminology_api", {
  "term": "substantia_nigra",
  "validation_type": "anatomical_nomenclature",
  "standard": "Terminologia_Anatomica"
})

# Research citation validation
fetch("crossref_api", {
  "doi": "research_citation",
  "validation_type": "academic_accuracy"
})

# Medical imaging cross-reference
fetch("brain_atlas_api", {
  "structure": "caudate_nucleus",
  "validation_type": "spatial_accuracy"
})
```

### Phase 6: Content Accuracy Scoring
**Use MCP `sequential-thinking`** to develop accuracy scoring system:
- **Anatomical Accuracy Score** (0-10): Structural correctness and spatial relationships
- **Clinical Relevance Score** (0-10): Medical significance and pathological accuracy
- **Educational Value Score** (0-10): Learning effectiveness and pedagogical quality
- **Research Currency Score** (0-10): Alignment with current medical knowledge
- **Expert Consensus Score** (0-10): Agreement among medical professionals

**Accuracy Scoring Implementation**:
```gdscript
