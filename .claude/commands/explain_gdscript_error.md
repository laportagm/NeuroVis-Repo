I encountered an error in my Godot project A1-NeuroVis while running it. Can you please help me understand what this error message and stack trace mean, what might be causing it, and suggest potential ways to fix it?
Please refer to our project's `ai_docs/scripting_conventions.md` if relevant for coding style or common patterns.

**Error Message & Stack Trace:**

**Relevant Script(s) or Scene(s) Involved (if known):**
- `{{RELEVANT_FILE_PATH_1}}`
- `{{RELEVANT_FILE_PATH_2}}`

Please provide:
1.  An explanation of the error.
2.  Likely causes based on the error and Godot common practices.
3.  Specific suggestions for debugging or fixing the issue in the context of GDScript and Godot.

I will replace the `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`.
