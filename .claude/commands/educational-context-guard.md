```

## Educational Context Enforcement
```
üéì EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT VALIDATION GUARD üéì

MANDATORY EDUCATIONAL FOCUS VALIDATION:

LEARNING_MISSION_CHECK:
‚úÖ How does this enhance medical education?
‚úÖ What specific learning objectives are addressed?
‚úÖ How does this serve healthcare professionals and students?
‚úÖ What clinical skills development is supported?
‚úÖ How does this improve anatomical understanding?

LEARNER_ACCESSIBILITY_VALIDATION:
‚úÖ Screen reader compatibility for visually impaired medical students?
‚úÖ Keyboard navigation for students with motor limitations?
‚úÖ Color contrast compliance for color-blind learners?
‚úÖ Clear language for diverse educational backgrounds?
‚úÖ Multiple learning modalities supported (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)?

CLINICAL_RELEVANCE_CHECK:
‚úÖ Medical terminology accuracy validated?
‚úÖ Anatomical representations clinically correct?
‚úÖ Educational content aligned with medical curriculum standards?
‚úÖ Pathology information clinically relevant and current?
‚úÖ Assessment tools educationally sound?

EDUCATIONAL_PLATFORM_INTEGRITY:
‚úÖ Maintains NeuroVis educational platform mission?
‚úÖ Supports structured learning pathways?
‚úÖ Enables progress tracking for educational assessment?
‚úÖ Facilitates instructor-guided learning sessions?
‚úÖ Promotes evidence-based medical education?

REJECTION_RULES:
‚ùå REJECT any request lacking educational justification
‚ùå REJECT changes that reduce learning effectiveness  
‚ùå REJECT features without accessibility consideration
‚ùå REJECT content without clinical accuracy validation
‚ùå REJECT implementations that ignore diverse learning needs

USER_REQUEST: ${USER_EDUCATIONAL_REQUEST}

RESPONSE_REQUIREMENTS:
- Lead with educational value proposition
- Include specific learning objectives addressed
- State clinical relevance clearly

## Educational Context Examples:

### ‚úÖ GOOD (Educational Context Clear):
"Add interactive quiz system to assess anatomical knowledge retention and provide immediate feedback for medical students learning neuroanatomy"

### ‚ùå BAD (No Educational Context):
"Add quiz system"

### ‚úÖ GOOD (Clinical Relevance):
"Enhance hippocampus visualization with pathology overlays to help students understand memory disorders and Alzheimer's disease progression"

### ‚ùå BAD (No Clinical Context):
"Make hippocampus look better"
