$(cat .claude/figma-exports/info-panel-design-spec.json)

Focus on:
1. Responsive layout system
2. Enhanced glass morphism
3. Collapsible sections
4. Smooth animations
5. Accessibility features"

# Command to implement the design:
claude "Based on the Figma design spec, create an enhanced version of ui_info_panel.gd with:
- Responsive width calculation (25% desktop, 40% tablet, 90% mobile)
- Collapsible sections with smooth animations
- Enhanced glass morphism effects
- Multiple action buttons (bookmark, share, close)
- Improved typography hierarchy
- Hover and click interactions

Use the design tokens from the JSON spec for all values."

- Add responsive breakpoint constants
- Create glass morphism effect methods
- Add animation curve definitions
- Implement hover/glow effect helpers
- Add accessibility color modes"

1. CollapsibleSection.gd - For expandable content sections
2. GlassPanel.gd - Base class for glass morphism panels
3. IconButton.gd - Consistent icon button behavior
4. ResponsiveContainer.gd - Handles responsive positioning"

- Design token reference
- Responsive layout guidelines
- Animation timing reference
- Accessibility checklist"
