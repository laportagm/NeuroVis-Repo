# Practical Figma to Godot Workflow Example

## üéØ Goal
Transform your NeuroVis info panel from a basic display to a professional, responsive, animated component using Figma design specifications.

## üìã What We Created

### 1. **Figma Design Specification** (`info-panel-design-spec.json`)
A complete design system export that includes:
- Color tokens with glass morphism values
- Typography scale and hierarchy
- Spacing system based on 8px grid
- Animation timings and curves
- Responsive breakpoints
- Interaction states

### 2. **Enhanced Component** (`enhanced_info_panel_v2.gd`)
A production-ready implementation featuring:
- ‚úÖ Responsive width (25% desktop, 40% tablet, 90% mobile)
- ‚úÖ Glass morphism with proper blur and transparency
- ‚úÖ Collapsible sections with smooth animations
- ‚úÖ Multiple action buttons (bookmark, share, close)
- ‚úÖ Hover effects on all interactive elements
- ‚úÖ Professional typography hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Accessibility considerations

### 3. **Workflow Script** (`figma-workflow-example.sh`)
Step-by-step process for design implementation

## üöÄ How to Use This Example

### Step 1: Review the Design Specification
```bash
# Look at the Figma export
cat .claude/figma-exports/info-panel-design-spec.json
```

### Step 2: Use Claude Code to Implement
```bash
# Basic implementation prompt
claude "Help me replace my current ui_info_panel.gd with the enhanced version in .claude/enhanced_info_panel_v2.gd, ensuring compatibility with my existing code"

# Design token integration
claude "Extract the design tokens from info-panel-design-spec.json and update my UIThemeManager.gd to use these professional values"

# Responsive system
claude "Create a ResponsiveLayoutManager based on the breakpoints in the Figma spec that I can use across all UI panels"
```

### Step 3: Test the Implementation
```bash
# Run your project
./quick_test.sh

# Fix any issues
claude "The panel animation is stuttering. Optimize the glass morphism effect for better performance"
```

## üìù Example Claude Code Prompts

### For Design Token Implementation:
```bash
claude "I have a Figma design spec at .claude/figma-exports/info-panel-design-spec.json. 
Help me:
1. Parse the JSON and extract all design tokens
2. Update UIThemeManager.gd with these values
3. Create helper methods for applying the tokens
4. Maintain backward compatibility"
```

### For Component Enhancement:
```bash
claude "Based on the enhanced_info_panel_v2.gd example:
1. Integrate it with my existing main_scene.gd
2. Connect it to my model_manager.gd for structure data
3. Add smooth transitions when switching structures
4. Ensure it works with my current signal system"
```

### For Animation Polish:
```bash
claude "Using the animation specs from the Figma design:
- entranceDuration: 0.4s with cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)
- hoverDuration: 0.15s
- Add these to all UI components for consistency"
```

## üé® Visual Improvements Achieved

### Before:
- Fixed 400px width
- Basic styling
- No hover effects
- Static layout
- Simple open/close

### After:
- Responsive sizing (25%/40%/90%)
- Advanced glass morphism
- Smooth hover animations
- Collapsible sections
- Multiple actions (bookmark/share)
- Professional polish

## üîÑ Iterative Improvement Process

1. **Export from Figma** ‚Üí Design specs as JSON
2. **Implement with Claude** ‚Üí Convert to GDScript
3. **Test in Godot** ‚Üí Run and identify issues
4. **Refine with Claude** ‚Üí Fix and optimize
5. **Document** ‚Üí Update your conventions

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to implement everything at once. Start with one component and perfect it.

### 2. Use the Design Spec
Reference the JSON values directly in your prompts to Claude Code for accuracy.

### 3. Test Frequently
Run your project after each major change to catch issues early.

### 4. Keep Original Code
Always backup your original files before making major changes.

### 5. Iterate
Use Claude Code to refine animations, fix edge cases, and optimize performance.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Try the Enhanced Panel**
   ```bash
   claude "Help me integrate enhanced_info_panel_v2.gd into my project, replacing the current info panel"
   ```

2. **Apply to Other Components**
   ```bash
   claude "Using the same Figma design principles, enhance my model_control_panel.gd"
   ```

3. **Create More Components**
   ```bash
   claude "Based on the design system, create a new NotificationToast component with glass morphism"
   ```

This example demonstrates how to create a professional UI enhancement workflow without complex Figma API integration - just smart use of design exports and Claude Code assistance!
