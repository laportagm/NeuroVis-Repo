TARGET FOLDER: ${1:-/Users/gagelaporta/Desktop/Neuro/NeuroVis-Repo/}

CLEANUP ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:

**Phase 1: File Discovery & Cataloging**
1. Recursively scan target folder and all subfolders
2. Create comprehensive file inventory with metadata
3. Categorize by file type (.gd, .tscn, .tres, .json, .md, etc.)
4. Identify file relationships and dependencies
5. Map educational content and medical accuracy implications

**Phase 2: Backup & Duplicate Detection**
1. Identify backup files (*.backup, *_backup.*, *_old.*, etc.)
2. Find duplicate class names across different locations
3. Detect versioned files (*_v1.*, *_v2.*, *_old, *_new, etc.)
4. Locate temporary files (*~, *.tmp, *.temp, etc.)
5. Identify conflicting educational content duplicates

**Phase 3: Deprecated & Unused File Analysis**
1. Scan for outdated Godot 3.x syntax in .gd files
2. Identify unused scene files not referenced in project
3. Find orphaned educational assets and 3D models
4. Detect deprecated autoload service implementations
5. Locate unused UI themes and educational components

**Phase 4: Conflict & Error Source Detection**
1. Find class name conflicts causing "hides global script class" errors
2. Identify files with parse errors and syntax issues
3. Detect broken educational workflow dependencies
4. Locate files causing autoload service conflicts
5. Find accessibility compliance violations in UI files

**Phase 5: Educational Integrity Assessment**
1. Identify outdated medical terminology or accuracy standards
2. Find deprecated learning pathway implementations
3. Detect unused 3D brain model variations
4. Locate obsolete accessibility compliance code
5. Identify conflicting educational objective definitions

**Phase 6: Performance Impact Analysis**
1. Find files causing 60fps performance degradation
2. Identify memory-intensive unused educational modules
3. Detect oversized 3D assets not meeting optimization standards
4. Locate inefficient rendering code in visualization components
5. Find accessibility overhead in unused UI components

**ANALYSIS CRITERIA FOR NEUROVIS:**
- **Educational Relevance:** Does file serve current learning objectives?

**CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS:**
For each problematic file, provide:
1. **Issue Type:** Backup/Duplicate/Deprecated/Conflict/Unused
2. **Educational Impact:** Effect on learning workflows
3. **Medical Accuracy Risk:** Potential for outdated content
4. **Performance Cost:** Memory/CPU/rendering impact
5. **Safe Removal:** Whether file can be safely deleted
6. **Alternative Action:** Move to archive, update, or refactor
7. **Dependencies:** What relies on this file

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
