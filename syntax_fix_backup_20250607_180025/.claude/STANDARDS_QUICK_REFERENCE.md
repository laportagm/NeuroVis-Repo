claude -f .claude/commands/architecture-enforcer.md "Your request"

# VS Code:
Ctrl+Shift+R

# Features:
✅ Directory placement validation
✅ NeuroVis modular structure enforced
✅ Autoload service compliance
✅ Code pattern validation
```

| `Ctrl+Shift+O` | 🏗️ Auto-Organize Project | Fix file organization |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | 🎯 Develop Educational Feature | Template-driven development |

## 🚀 **Daily Workflow**

### **Development Session Routine:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+S` - Check current standards compliance
2. `Ctrl+Shift+U` - Develop with ultimate standards enforcement
3. `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Run test suite
4. `Ctrl+Shift+G` - Launch NeuroVis for testing

### **Feature Development:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+U` - "Add [educational feature]"
2. `Ctrl+Shift+O` - Auto-organize any new files
3. `Ctrl+Shift+S` - Validate compliance
4. `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Test implementation

### **Bug Fixing:**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+U` - "Fix [educational issue] in [file]"
2. `Ctrl+Shift+S` - Validate fix doesn't break standards
3. `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Confirm fix works

## 🎓 **Standards Enforcement Examples**

### **✅ EXCELLENT Examples (Will Pass All Validation):**

#### Feature Development:
```bash
claude -f .claude/commands/ultimate-validator.md "Add interactive neuroanatomy quiz system for medical students to assess hippocampus knowledge with immediate feedback and progress tracking"
```

#### Bug Fixing:
```bash
claude -f .claude/commands/ultimate-validator.md "Fix memory leak in educational 3D brain model loading while maintaining 60fps performance and accessibility compliance"
```

#### Code Review:
```bash
claude -f .claude/commands/ultimate-validator.md "Review educational panel code for NeuroVis standards compliance, accessibility, clinical accuracy, and performance optimization"
```

### **❌ REJECTED Examples (Will Be Automatically Rejected):**

```bash
# Missing educational context
claude "Make it look better"

# No architecture consideration  
claude "Add new feature"

# No accessibility mention
claude "Change UI colors"

# No performance consideration
claude "Add more 3D models"
```

## 🛡️ **What Gets Enforced**

### **Educational Context (Always Required):**
- Learning objectives clearly stated
- Clinical relevance explained
- Medical education value demonstrated
- Accessibility for diverse learners

### **Architecture Compliance (Strictly Enforced):**
- File placement in correct NeuroVis directories
- Use of established autoload services
- Modular educational structure preserved
- No danger-zone file modifications

### **Code Quality (Automatically Validated):**
- PascalCase classes, snake_case methods
- Educational documentation with learning objectives
- Performance budgets (60fps, <500MB memory)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### **Clinical Accuracy (Medical Standards):**
- Medical terminology accuracy
- Anatomical data consistency
- Educational content validation
- Pathology information accuracy

## 🚨 **Automatic Rejection Triggers**

Claude responses will be **automatically rejected** if missing:
- ❌ Educational context or learning objectives
- ❌ CLAUDE.md standards reference
- ❌ Architecture compliance validation
- ❌ Accessibility consideration
- ❌ Performance impact assessment
