ðŸ§  NEUROVIS SMART DEVELOPMENT REQUEST ðŸ§ 

CONTEXT LOADING:
âœ… Project: NeuroVis educational neuroscience platform
âœ… Current State: [Reference .claude/current-project-state.md]
âœ… Architecture: Modular Godot 4.4.1 educational system
âœ… Standards: CLAUDE.md + Code Quality + Educational Excellence
âœ… Performance: 60fps, <500MB memory, accessibility compliant

DEVELOPMENT REQUEST ENHANCEMENT:

Original Request: "${USER_REQUEST}"

Enhanced Context:
- Educational Goal: [What learning objective does this serve?]
- Target Users: Medical students and healthcare professionals
- Integration Points: [How does this connect to existing NeuroVis systems?]
- Performance Impact: [Memory/CPU considerations for educational platform]
- Accessibility: [WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for diverse learners]
- Medical Accuracy: [Clinical relevance and anatomical correctness]

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
âœ… Complete GDScript type safety with educational documentation
âœ… NeuroVis architecture compliance (core/, ui/, scenes/, assets/)
âœ… Educational context in all code (learning objectives + clinical relevance)
âœ… Performance optimization for 3D educational interactions
âœ… Accessibility features for inclusive medical education
âœ… Error handling with educational user feedback
âœ… Integration with existing autoload services (KnowledgeService, etc.)

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
1. Educational Context Section - Learning objectives and clinical relevance
2. Technical Implementation - Production-ready GDScript code
3. Architecture Compliance - Proper file placement and patterns
4. Performance Assessment - Impact on educational platform
5. Testing Strategy - Validation approach for educational functionality
6. Integration Notes - How this connects to existing NeuroVis systems

EXECUTE WITH MAXIMUM NEUROVIS EDUCATIONAL PLATFORM EFFECTIVENESS.

## Usage Examples:

### Instead of:
"Add quiz system"

### Use:
"Reference .claude/current-project-state.md and implement interactive neuroanatomy quiz system for medical students that integrates with existing KnowledgeService, maintains 60fps performance during 3D brain interactions, and supports accessibility compliance for diverse learning needs"

### Instead of:
"Fix the error"

### Use:
"Based on current NeuroVis architecture in .claude/current-project-state.md, debug and fix the ContentComponent configure() error while preserving educational functionality and maintaining standards compliance according to CLAUDE.md patterns"
