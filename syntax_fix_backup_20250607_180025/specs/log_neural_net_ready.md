# Spec: Log NeuralNet Scene Ready Status

## 1. Objective
Modify the `NeuralNet.gd` script (associated with `res://scenes/NeuralNet.tscn`, which is currently conceptual or may be based on `res://scenes/node_3d.tscn`) to print a confirmation message to the Godot output console when the scene has finished loading and its `_ready()` function is called.

## 2. Background
This is a simple initial diagnostic feature. It will help confirm that the `NeuralNet` scene and its script are being correctly instanced and initialized as part of the main application flow. This is particularly useful in early-stage development for debugging scene loading and script execution. Refer to `ai_docs/scene_architecture.md` for context on scene relationships.

## 3. Requirements
-   Locate or create the script `res://scripts/NeuralNet.gd`. If it doesn't exist, create a basic script that extends `Node3D` (or an appropriate base type for your neural network visualization).
-   In this script, find or implement the `_ready()` virtual function. Godot automatically calls this function when a node and all its children have entered the scene tree.
-   Inside the `_ready()` function, add a line of GDScript code to print a clear and identifiable message to the Godot output console. For example: `print("NeuralNet scene is ready and initialized.")`.
-   Ensure this change adheres to the conventions outlined in `ai_docs/scripting_conventions.md`.

## 4. Key Files/Scenes to Modify or Create
-   **Modify/Create:** `res://scripts/NeuralNet.gd`
-   **Contextual Scene:** `res://scenes/NeuralNet.tscn` (or `res://scenes/node_3d.tscn` if that's the current target for `NeuralNet.gd`)

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
-   When the project is run and the `NeuralNet` scene (or the scene associated with `NeuralNet.gd`) is instanced and becomes ready:
    -   The specified message (e.g., "NeuralNet scene is ready and initialized.") appears clearly in the Godot Output panel.
    -   No errors related to this script modification occur during project startup or scene loading.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Neural Network Mesh Structure Logs

This section contains logs of the mesh structure names found in the 3D models used in the NeuroVis application. This information is helpful for debugging and improving the mapping between mesh names and structure IDs in the knowledge base.

### Known Mesh Names

These names have been observed in the 3D models:

- Thalamus
- Hippocampus
- Amygdala
- Midbrain
- Pons
- Medulla
- Corpus_Callosum
- Brainstem
- Cerebellum
- Frontal_Lobe
- Temporal_Lobe
- Parietal_Lobe
- Occipital_Lobe

### Potential Naming Variations

Different 3D modeling software and artists may use different naming conventions:

- Using spaces: "Frontal Lobe" vs "Frontal_Lobe"
- Using CamelCase: "FrontalLobe" vs "Frontal_Lobe"
- Using underscores: "Frontal_Lobe"
- Lowercase: "frontal_lobe" vs "Frontal_Lobe"
- Abbreviated: "FC" (Frontal Cortex) vs "Frontal_Lobe"
- Full anatomical: "Medulla Oblongata" vs "Medulla"

### Debugging Steps

If you're having trouble with structure identification:

1. Enable DEBUG_MODE in node_3d.gd
2. Click on structures and check the console output
3. Look for "Selected structure:" log entries
4. Add any new mesh names to the NeuralNet.gd structure_map
5. Update this log file with newly discovered mesh names
