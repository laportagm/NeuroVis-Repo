# Product Requirements Document: Claude Code – Your Evolving AI Development Partner in VS Code

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** Thursday, May 15, 2025 at 7:42:37 PM EDT
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** AI-Assisted (via Gemini) & Project Lead
**Location:** United States

## 0. Executive Summary & Overarching Vision

**Vision:** To create **Claude Code**, an intelligent, deeply integrated AI development partner within Visual Studio Code, designed to understand the full context of a software project—its goals, architecture, code, and its rich documentation (such as the detailed Markdown files found in the user's `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` directory)—and proactively assist developers throughout the entire application lifecycle. Claude Code aims to be more than a code completion tool; it strives to be a persistent, evolving knowledge base and collaborative assistant that enhances productivity, improves code quality, accelerates learning, and helps maintain complex projects over the long term. It will achieve this by intelligently storing, retrieving, and reasoning over project-specific context, adapting to the evolving needs of the developer and the project itself.

---

## 1. Purpose
We are building Claude Code to fundamentally transform the developer experience within VS Code by providing an always-available, contextually aware AI partner. The core purposes are:

* **To Dramatically Enhance Developer Productivity:** By automating boilerplate code generation, providing intelligent code suggestions, assisting with complex algorithms, and streamlining repetitive tasks (debugging, refactoring, documentation).
* **To Improve Code Quality & Maintainability:** By offering insights into best practices, identifying potential bugs or anti-patterns, promoting consistent coding styles, and assisting in the creation of clear, comprehensive documentation.
* **To Accelerate Learning & Onboarding:** By explaining complex code, clarifying new technologies or frameworks, and providing context-specific guidance, effectively acting as an on-demand tutor.
* **To Provide Deep Project Understanding & Context Management:** By building and maintaining a rich understanding of the specific project being worked on—including its architecture, dependencies, code, and key planning documents (e.g., a `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` or `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.MD` if present in the project's `docs/` folder)—thereby reducing context-switching and cognitive load for developers.
* **To Serve as a "Living Document" and Evolving Project Reference:** By not only consuming project documentation (such as user-created `USER_STORIES.md`, phase-specific guides like `PHASE_1_CORE_3D_VISUALIZATION_AND_BASIC_INTERACTION.md`, or process documents like `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_AND_PROCESS.md`) but also helping to create and maintain it, ensuring that the project's knowledge base evolves alongside the code.
* **To Support Long-Term Development and Maintenance:** By retaining project context across sessions and over time, assisting with understanding legacy code, and helping to manage the evolution of complex applications.

---

## 2. Problem statement
Modern software development, even for solo developers like the one undertaking the `A1-NeuroVis` project, presents significant challenges that Claude Code aims to address:

* **Information Overload & Context Switching:** Developers constantly switch between coding, debugging, reading documentation (which, even if well-organized as in the `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` structure, can be extensive), and managing project requirements, leading to cognitive friction and reduced focus. Retrieving relevant project context quickly is often difficult.
* **Boilerplate & Repetitive Tasks:** Significant development time is spent on writing repetitive boilerplate code, setting up project structures, or performing routine refactoring tasks.
* **Steep Learning Curves:** Developers frequently encounter new languages, frameworks (like Godot, as used in `A1-NeuroVis`), libraries, or unfamiliar parts of a codebase, requiring substantial time for research and understanding.
* **Maintaining Code Quality & Consistency:** Ensuring consistent coding styles, adhering to best practices, and writing thorough documentation can be challenging, especially under tight deadlines or in solo projects.
* **Understanding & Navigating Large/Legacy Codebases:** Getting up to speed on complex or unfamiliar projects can be time-consuming and daunting.
* **Documentation Lag:** Project documentation, despite best efforts (like having detailed phase plans in `docs/Roadmap_Docs/`), can fall behind active development, becoming outdated and less useful. Claude Code aims to help bridge this.
* **Debugging Complexity:** Identifying and fixing bugs in complex systems can be a slow and frustrating process.
* **Solo Developer Limitations:** Solo developers lack immediate peer support for brainstorming, code reviews, or tackling difficult problems. Claude Code will act as a knowledgeable AI peer.

Claude Code will address these by providing intelligent, context-aware assistance directly within the developer's primary work environment (VS Code), leveraging the rich information already present in their project structure and documentation.

## 3. Objectives & success metrics
**Objectives:**

1.  **O1: Enhance Code Generation Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time developers spend writing boilerplate and common code patterns, leveraging project-specific conventions.
2.  **O2: Improve Code Understanding & Debugging Speed:** Enable developers to understand unfamiliar code (within their `scripts/` or other code directories) and identify/fix bugs more quickly, using project context for better diagnostics.
3.  **O3: Increase Project Context Awareness:** Ensure Claude Code provides suggestions and answers that are highly relevant to the current project (e.g., `A1-NeuroVis`), its specific files (like `project.godot` or files in `scenes/`), and the current task as outlined in project documentation (e.g., current phase in `docs/Roadmap_Docs/`).
4.  **O4: Streamline Documentation Processes:** Assist in both generating and consuming project-specific documentation, potentially helping to keep files like `README.md` or `CLAUDE.md` (if it contains project notes for Claude) updated.
5.  **O5: Facilitate Long-Term Project Maintainability:** Help developers understand and evolve code written by themselves (long ago) or by others, by recalling past context and architectural decisions (potentially gleaned from project docs).
6.  **O6: Become an Indispensable Part of the VS Code Workflow:** Achieve high user adoption and satisfaction among target developer personas.
7.  **O7: Leverage User-Defined AI Priming:** If users have existing mechanisms for priming AI context (e.g., files like `context_prime.md` in a `.claude` folder, as seen in the `A1-NeuroVis` structure), Claude Code should be able to utilize this information.

## 4. Personas & use cases
**Personas:**

* **P1: Julia, the Junior Developer / Learner (like the developer of `A1-NeuroVis`)**
    * *Needs:* Guidance on Godot/GDScript (based on `project.godot`), explanations of unfamiliar code found in `scripts/`, help structuring new `.tscn` files in `scenes/`, assistance understanding and implementing tasks from her detailed phase documents (e.g., `docs/Roadmap_Docs/PHASE_2...md`), help creating content for `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`.
    * *Pain Points:* Getting stuck on framework-specific issues, understanding how to translate requirements from her PRD (`docs/PRD.md` or the one we are creating now) into code.
* **P2: Alex, the Mid-Level Solo Developer / Indie Hacker**
    * *Needs:* Tools to accelerate development, help with context management across all their project files (code, assets, extensive documentation), quick feature prototyping, support for maintaining their codebase solo.
* **P3: Maria, the Senior Developer / Tech Lead**
    * *Needs:* Assistance with complex architectural decisions by having Claude Code understand existing architecture docs, understanding legacy code, ensuring team code consistency by referencing style guides (if present), quickly generating unit tests, automating aspects of documentation.

**Use Cases (Illustrative, referencing `A1-NeuroVis` structure where applicable):**

* **UC1 (Code Generation & Completion - P1, P2, P3):**
    * *Scenario:* Julia needs to add a new UI scene in `A1-NeuroVis/scenes/` for displaying AI responses, as per her `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md`.
    * *Claude Code Action:* She prompts: "Based on my `UI_UX_DESIGN_NOTES.md` section for AI responses, generate the Godot scene structure (nodes) and a basic GDScript for `AIResponsePanel.tscn` in my `scenes/` directory. It should include a RichTextLabel."
* **UC2 (Code Explanation & Learning - P1, P2):**
    * *Scenario:* Alex is reviewing a GDScript file in `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/` that handles API calls for the in-app AI, as planned in `PHASE_3_IN_APP_AI_ASSISTANT_ONLINE_API.md`.
    * *Claude Code Action:* Alex selects a complex function and asks: "/explain_code". Claude Code explains it, referencing concepts from the Godot HTTPRequest class.
* **UC3 (Debugging Assistance - P1, P2, P3):**
    * *Scenario:* Julia's Godot project (`A1-NeuroVis/project.godot`) throws an error related to loading data from her planned `assets/data/anatomical_data.json`.
    * *Claude Code Action:* Julia provides the error and the GDScript snippet from `scripts/` that loads the JSON. Claude Code, aware of the `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`, might suggest issues related to file paths (`res://assets/data/...`) or JSON parsing errors.
* **UC4 (Project-Specific Q&A & Context Retrieval - P2, P3, useful for P1 too):**
    * *Scenario:* The developer of `A1-NeuroVis` wants to remember the exact fields defined for their anatomical knowledge base.
    * *Claude Code Action:* Asks: "/ask_project What is the schema for my anatomical data?" Claude Code, having indexed `A1-NeuroVis/docs/Expansion/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`, provides the detailed JSON schema.
* **UC5 (Documentation Generation - P1, P2, P3):**
    * *Scenario:* Julia finishes a new GDScript function in `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/`.
    * *Claude Code Action:* She selects the function and prompts: "/gen_docstring". Claude Code generates a GDScript docstring. She might also ask, "Based on this new function, help me update the relevant section in `PHASE_X_...md`."
* **UC6 (Leveraging User's Custom Claude CLI Setup - P1):**
    * *Scenario:* Julia has a `context_prime.md` in her `A1-NeuroVis/.claude/commands/` folder that contains general priming instructions for how she likes Claude to respond.
    * *Claude Code Action:* Claude Code (the VS Code extension) could be configured to optionally read this `context_prime.md` at the start of a session or project loading to align its general responses with her preferences, complementing its deeper project-specific analysis.

    * Acceptance Criteria: Inline actions are non-intrusive and contextually relevant.
* **FR3.3: Slash Commands & Customization:**
    * Requirement: Support predefined slash commands. Explore integration or synergy with user-defined command structures if found in a project (e.g., potentially referencing user's own commands in `A1-NeuroVis/.claude/commands/` as inspiration for personalized quick actions, or allowing user to register prompts from there).
    * Acceptance Criteria: Slash commands streamline common interactions.
* **FR3.4: Clear Indication of AI-Generated Content:**
    * Requirement: Visually differentiate AI-generated code or text.
    * Acceptance Criteria: Users can easily identify the source of code suggestions.

## 6. Non-functional Requirements

* **Performance:**
    * Inline code suggestions: <500ms.
    * Chat responses for common queries referencing loaded project context: 2-10s (depending on complexity and context size).
    * Background project analysis for context building (initial and incremental) should be efficient and allow user to continue working without significant VS Code slowdown. Progress should be indicated.
* **Security:**
    * Code snippets and project context (including content from `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` and `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/`) sent to Claude models must be handled via HTTPS and according to Claude's data privacy and security policies.
    * User API keys for the Claude Code service must be stored securely using VS Code's secret storage.
    * Claude Code should not store sensitive information from the project unencrypted in its local cache if that cache is easily accessible.
* **Accessibility:**
    * The Claude Code UI within VS Code must adhere to VS Code's accessibility standards.
* **Reliability & Availability:**
    * Claude Code service (if cloud-dependent) should have high uptime.
    * VS Code extension should be stable.
    * Graceful degradation if cloud services are temporarily unavailable (e.g., inform user, potentially fall back to more limited local context analysis if feasible).
* **Scalability (of Context Understanding):**
    * Claude Code should effectively manage context for projects like `A1-NeuroVis`, even as its documentation suite and codebase grow. Strategies for indexing and summarizing large documents will be employed.
* **Usability:**
    * The extension should be intuitive for developers. Onboarding for new users should highlight context sources like existing project documentation.
* **Resource Consumption:**
    * Background indexing and analysis should be configurable to manage CPU and memory usage.

---

## 7. Evolving Vision & Long-Term Development Support

Claude Code is envisioned not as a static tool but as a partner that evolves with the developer and their project over its entire lifecycle.

* **Adaptive Contextualization:** As `A1-NeuroVis` grows (more scripts, scenes, expanded documentation in `docs/`), Claude Code's internal knowledge base for the project will update, ensuring its understanding remains current. It will learn from new patterns, architectural changes reflected in code and documents like an updated `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.MD` (which should be created by the user in the future).
* **Support Through Refactoring & Maintenance:** When revisiting older code in `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/`, Claude Code will leverage its historical context (if available through indexed docs or its KB) to help explain rationale or identify dependencies.
* **Facilitating Project Handovers or Onboarding:** If `A1-NeuroVis` were ever to involve more developers, Claude Code (having indexed its rich documentation) could act as an onboarding assistant, answering questions about the project based on its established knowledge.
* **Roadmap Awareness:** Claude Code could be made aware of the project's future plans by referencing `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` (Nice-to-Haves, Future) and `CONTENT_EXPANSION_PLAN.md` to offer suggestions aligned with long-term goals.
* **Continuous Learning (for Claude Code itself):** Feedback mechanisms will allow users to indicate when Claude Code's context understanding is particularly good or needs improvement, helping to refine its context-gathering heuristics for all users over time (this refers to the general model improvement by the AI provider, not user-specific retraining).

---

## 8. Project Context Storage & Retrieval Mechanism (Detailed)

Claude Code will employ a multi-layered approach to build and utilize project context for `A1-NeuroVis`:

1.  **Ephemeral Session Context:**
    * **Storage:** In-memory during an active VS Code chat session with Claude Code.
    * **Content:** Current conversation history, recently selected/viewed code snippets from `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/` or scenes from `A1-NeuroVis/scenes/`, active editor tabs.
    * **Retrieval:** Immediate access by the AI for conversational follow-up.
2.  **Active VS Code State Context:**
    * **Storage:** Dynamically read from VS Code's current state.
    * **Content:** Full content of currently open and active files, cursor position, selections, diagnostic errors from VS Code.
    * **Retrieval:** Real-time access to provide highly immediate, localized context.
3.  **Workspace-Level Indexed Context (Claude Code's Persistent Project Knowledge Base):**
    * **Storage:** A dedicated, efficient, indexed knowledge store managed by Claude Code, specific to the `A1-NeuroVis` workspace. This would likely reside in a hidden folder within the workspace (e.g., `.vscode/.claude_code_cache/A1-NeuroVis/`) or in VS Code's global extension storage, tied to the workspace ID.
    * **Initial Population & Updates:**
        * On first opening `A1-NeuroVis`, or when triggered by the user, Claude Code will perform an initial scan and indexing of key project files.
        * It will prioritize:
            * Recognized documentation files in `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` (e.g., `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.MD`, `USER_STORIES.md`, all phase documents in `Roadmap_Docs/`, schema files in `Expansion/`, etc.).
            * Project configuration files (e.g., `project.godot`).
            * Source code files (e.g., in `scripts/`, `.tscn` files in `scenes/`).
            * The user's custom priming context if available (e.g., `A1-NeuroVis/.claude/commands/context_prime.md`).
        * Subsequent updates will occur incrementally and intelligently (e.g., on file save, Git branch change, or periodic refresh).
    * **Content of this KB:** Embeddings of text and code, summaries, extracted entities (classes, functions, key terms from docs), dependency maps, links between documentation and code.
    * **Retrieval:** When a query is made, Claude Code will perform a semantic search over this indexed KB to retrieve the most relevant chunks of information. These chunks are then provided to the LLM as augmented context alongside the user's direct prompt.
    * *(This KB is internal to Claude Code; the user does not directly edit it but benefits from its existence through more informed AI responses.)*
4.  **User-Pinned Global Context:**
    * **Storage:** User configuration within Claude Code settings.
    * **Content:** User can specify paths to key files or folders (e.g., "Always consider `A1-NeuroVis/docs/Setup_Documentation/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `A1-NeuroVis/docs/Expansion/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md` as high-priority context").
    * **Retrieval:** This context is always prioritized and loaded/referenced by Claude Code for relevant queries.

---

## 9. Claude Code as an Evolving Project Reference

By building and maintaining its Workspace-Level Indexed Context (FR2.5), Claude Code becomes more than just a coding assistant; it becomes a dynamic, evolving reference for the `A1-NeuroVis` project:

* **Answers "Where is...?" or "How does...?" Questions:** "Where is the logic for loading anatomical data defined?" (Claude Code checks its index of `scripts/` and `docs/DATA_STORAGE_AND_ACCESS_PLAN.md`). "How does the selection highlighting feature work, according to the Phase 1 plan?" (Claude Code checks `docs/Roadmap_Docs/PHASE_1_...md`).
* **Surfaces Relevant Documentation:** When working on a piece of code, Claude Code can proactively suggest or retrieve relevant sections from `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` that describe its purpose or requirements.
* **Tracks (Conceptually) Architectural Evolution:** By indexing documentation and code over time (and potentially integrating with Git history in future versions), Claude Code could provide insights into why certain decisions were made (if documented).
* **Assists in Onboarding:** If a new person (or the original developer after a long break) needs to understand `A1-NeuroVis`, they can query Claude Code about its structure, key features, and data flows, effectively querying the indexed project documentation and code.

---

## 10. Optimizing Project & Documentation Structure for Claude Code Assistance

Claude Code will be designed to work best with well-structured projects and documentation. The existing structure of `A1-NeuroVis` with its detailed `docs/` directory is an excellent foundation.

* **Leveraging the Existing `A1-NeuroVis` Documentation:**
    * Claude Code will be configured to recognize and prioritize files within `A1-NeuroVis/docs/` as key sources of truth for project goals, specifications, plans, and schemas.
    * The clear naming convention (e.g., `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `PHASE_X_...md`) will help Claude Code categorize and understand the purpose of each document.
* **Maintaining Granular Documentation:** Continue creating detailed, focused Markdown files as planned (e.g., phase-specific guides, plans for data, content, AI usage). This fine-grained information is easier for Claude Code to index and retrieve accurately.
* **Code Modularity and Clarity:**
    * Well-named files and functions in `A1-NeuroVis/scripts/` and clear scene organization in `A1-NeuroVis/scenes/` will improve Claude Code's ability to understand code context.
    * Comprehensive docstrings in GDScript files will be indexed and used.
* **Consistency is Key:** Maintaining consistent terminology between your documentation (`docs/`) and your code (`scripts/`, `scenes/`) will enhance Claude Code's ability to draw correct inferences.
* **Claude Code's Internal Storage:** As mentioned (FR2.5), Claude Code will maintain its *own* indexed representation of the project's context. This would be stored in a dedicated cache location (e.g., within the project's `.vscode/` folder or a workspace-specific extension storage) to avoid cluttering the main `A1-NeuroVis` file tree. This is *not* a new file the user needs to manually create or manage for their project's design, but rather an internal mechanism of Claude Code.
* **Potential for Future `claude_code_config.json`:** *(This is a future consideration if it becomes necessary)* A file like `A1-NeuroVis/.claude_code_config.json` could be introduced in the future to allow users to explicitly tell Claude Code:
    * Which directories/files are most important for context.
    * Project-specific terminology or acronyms.
    * Preferred coding style parameters if not covered by linters.
    * This file would be *for configuring Claude Code's behavior for this specific project*, not a core design document of the project itself.

By maintaining your excellent documentation discipline and a clear code structure, you are already optimizing `A1-NeuroVis` for effective assistance from an advanced AI tool like the envisioned Claude Code. Claude Code, in turn, would aim to make the management and utilization of this rich project information seamless.

## 11. Dependencies & risks
* **D1: Underlying LLM Availability & Performance:** Claude Code's core intelligence relies on access to powerful Large Language Models (Claude family). Service outages, API changes, or performance degradation of these models are significant risks.
    * *Mitigation:* Robust error handling, clear communication to users about service status, potential for fallback to more limited offline/local capabilities if feasible in future iterations.
* **D2: Quality of LLM Responses:** LLMs can "hallucinate" or provide incorrect/suboptimal code or information.
    * *Mitigation:* Rigorous testing of Claude Code's outputs, clear disclaimers to users, features to allow users to rate/report bad suggestions, encouraging critical review by the developer.
* **D3: VS Code API Changes:** Claude Code's integration depends on VS Code extension APIs. Breaking changes in VS Code could require significant rework.
    * *Mitigation:* Stay updated with VS Code API developments, use stable APIs where possible, allocate resources for maintenance.
* **D4: Context Window Limitations:** LLMs have finite context windows. Handling very large files or extremely complex project-wide queries effectively will be an ongoing challenge.
    * *Mitigation:* Intelligent context chunking, summarization techniques, efficient indexing for the persistent project knowledge base (FR2.5).
* **D5: Security & Privacy of User Code:** Users will be sending code snippets and project context to an AI service.
    * *Mitigation:* Ensure all communication is encrypted (HTTPS). Clear data handling policies. For on-premise/enterprise versions (future), explore options for local model deployment. Transparency with users about what data is used and how.
* **D6: User Over-Reliance & Skill Atrophy:** Risk that developers might become too dependent on AI and not develop their own critical thinking or problem-solving skills.
    * *Mitigation:* Emphasize Claude Code as an *assistant* and *tutor*. Encourage users to understand suggested code (e.g., via built-in explanation features). Promote it as a tool for learning and exploration, not just a black box code generator.
* External API X version ≥ 2.1 * Legal review ---

## 12. Release criteria & timeline
