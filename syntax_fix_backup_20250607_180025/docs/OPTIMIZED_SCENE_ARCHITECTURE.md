# Optimized NeuroVis Scene Architecture

This document describes the optimized scene architecture for the NeuroVis educational platform, focusing on performance, maintainability, and educational effectiveness.

## Architecture Overview

The new architecture follows a structured, modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
NeuroVisRoot (Node)
├── Services (Node) - Core application services
│   ├── SceneManager - Handles scene transitions
│   ├── StructureManager - Manages brain structure data
│   └── UIComponentPool - UI component optimization
├── ResourceCache (Node) - Shared resource management
├── SceneManager (Node) - Educational scene container
│   ├── MainEducationalScene (Node3D) - 3D visualization
│   │   ├── World (Node3D) - 3D environment
│   │   └── Systems (Node) - Core educational systems
│   └── UIController (Node) - UI management
│       └── UI (CanvasLayer) - User interface elements
```

## Key Components

### 1. Service Layer

The Services node contains singleton-like service providers that are accessible throughout the application:

#### SceneManager

The `SceneManager` improves educational experience through:
- Optimized asynchronous scene loading with progress tracking
- Scene transition management with smooth educational effects
- Memory optimization through scene caching and unloading
- Consistent error handling and recovery

```gdscript
# Example usage
SceneManager.change_scene("res://scenes/detailed_view.tscn")
```

#### StructureManager

The `StructureManager` enhances educational effectiveness by:
- Centralizing access to anatomical structure data
- Efficient caching of commonly accessed information
- Identifying and exposing relationships between structures
- Supporting comparative educational visualization

```gdscript
# Example usage
StructureManager.select_structure("Hippocampus")
var related = StructureManager.find_related_structures("Amygdala", RelationshipType.FUNCTIONAL)
```

#### UIComponentPool

The `UIComponentPool` dramatically improves UI performance through:
- Object pooling of frequently used UI components
- Reduction of instantiation overhead during educational interactions
- Consistent component configuration and theming
- Memory usage optimization

```gdscript
# Example usage
var panel = UIComponentPool.get_component("info_panel", {
    "title": "Hippocampus",
    "theme": "enhanced"
})
# When done with component
UIComponentPool.release_component(panel)
```

### 2. World Organization

The 3D world is structured for optimal performance and educational clarity:

```
World (Node3D)
├── Environment (Node3D) - Lighting and camera
├── BrainModels (Node3D) - Educational 3D models
│   ├── ModelSets (Node3D) - Different visualization modes
│   │   ├── WholeBrain (Node3D)
│   │   ├── HalfBrain (Node3D) 
│   │   └── InternalStructures (Node3D)
│   └── SharedResources (Node) - Common resources
└── Annotations (Node3D) - Educational markers
```

This organization delivers:
- Clear separation between different visualization modes
- Resource sharing for improved memory efficiency
- Optimized scene traversal for raycast operations
- Logical grouping for educational context

### 3. Systems Architecture

The Systems node organizes core functionality into logical, maintainable subsystems:

```
Systems (Node)
├── InteractionSystem (Node) - Input and camera
├── SelectionSystem (Node) - Structure selection
├── VisualizationSystem (Node) - Visual enhancements
└── EducationalSystem (Node) - Learning features
```

Each system is focused on a specific aspect of the educational experience:

#### InteractionSystem
Handles user input and camera control with:
- Centralized input routing through `InputRouter`
- Optimized camera behavior for educational viewing
- Touch and gesture support for diverse devices
- Educational focus transitions

#### SelectionSystem
Manages structure selection with improved performance:

- Structure highlighting with educational significance
- Cross-section visualization for internal views
- Educational annotation management
- Visual hierarchy for learning focus

#### EducationalSystem
Delivers structured learning experiences:
- Guided learning pathways
- Structure comparison for educational insight
- Progress tracking for educational analytics
- Educational content integration

### 4. UI Architecture

The UI is organized for responsiveness and educational clarity:

```
UI (CanvasLayer)
├── Regions (Control) - Layout areas
│   ├── Header (PanelContainer)
│   ├── SidePanel_Left (PanelContainer)
│   ├── SidePanel_Right (PanelContainer)
│   └── Footer (PanelContainer)
├── Components (Control) - Reusable elements
├── Modals (Control) - Overlay dialogs
└── Accessibility (Node) - A11y features
```

This organization provides:
- Clear spatial organization for responsive layouts
