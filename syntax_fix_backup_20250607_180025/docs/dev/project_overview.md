# A1-NeuroVis Project Overview

## Project Goal
To create an interactive 3D visualization of neural networks and their activity using the Godot Engine. This project aims to provide tools for researchers and enthusiasts to explore and understand complex neural architectures.

## Godot Version
This project uses Godot Engine 4.2.

## Core Technologies
- Godot Engine (GDScript primarily)
- [Placeholder for any significant third-party C# libraries, GDExtensions, or specialized tools if planned for use, e.g., a specific data parsing library]

## Main Entry Point
The main scene intended to launch when the project runs is expected to be `res://scenes/Main.tscn` or a similar top-level scene.
*(Note: Currently, only `node_3d.tscn` exists. This section should be updated as the main scene is developed).*

## Project Structure Overview
- **`scenes/`**: Contains all Godot scene files (`.tscn`).
- **`scripts/`**: Contains all GDScript files (`.gd`).
- **`assets/`**: Stores all project assets like 3D models, textures, icons, and data files.
- **`shaders/`**: Intended for custom shader files (`.gdshader`) if any.
- **`ai_docs/`**: This directory, for AI-readable documentation about the project.
- **`specs/`**: For detailed specifications of features to be implemented.
- **`.claude/commands/`**: Stores reusable prompts for AI interaction.
