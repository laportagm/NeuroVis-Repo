# ü§ñ Claude AI Integration Guide for NeuroVis

This document provides guidance on using Claude AI effectively within the NeuroVis educational platform development workflow.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Set up Claude Code environment
./setup_claude_code.sh

# Run Claude Code with project configuration
./run_claude_code.sh
```

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Ask Claude a specific question
./run_claude_code.sh -p "How should I implement error handling in GeminiAIService.gd?"

# Start interactive Claude session
./run_claude_code.sh
```

## üí° Effective Prompting Strategies

### Educational Feature Development
When developing educational features:
```
Please help me implement [feature] for the NeuroVis educational platform.
The feature should [educational purpose] and integrate with our existing
knowledge services. Please follow our standard error handling patterns
and educational naming conventions.
```

### Code Refactoring
When improving existing code:
```
I need to refactor the [component] to improve [aspect]. Please help me
identify issues and suggest improvements while maintaining educational
context and proper error handling.
```

### Bug Fixing
When fixing issues:
```
I'm experiencing [issue] in the [component]. Here's the error message:
[error]. Please help me diagnose and fix this issue following our
educational development standards.
```

### Documentation Generation
When creating documentation:
```
Please generate educational documentation for [component] following our
standard format. Include: overview, educational purpose, usage examples,
error handling, and educational context.
```

## üß© Integration Workflows

### AI-Assisted Feature Development Workflow
1. Create feature requirements document
2. Ask Claude to draft initial implementation
3. Review and enhance the implementation
4. Add educational context and proper error handling
5. Test with educational scenarios
6. Document with Claude's assistance

### Code Review Workflow
1. Share code with Claude
2. Ask for specific improvement areas
3. Apply targeted enhancements
4. Validate educational integrity
5. Generate review summary

### Educational Content Validation
1. Share anatomical content with Claude
2. Request medical terminology verification
3. Enhance educational context
4. Validate learning objectives
5. Generate educational metadata

## üèóÔ∏è Claude Code Project Organization

Claude can help with:
- Code structure recommendations
- Educational naming suggestions
- Documentation generation
- Error handling patterns
- Educational context enhancement
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility improvements

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Be specific** about educational requirements
2. **Provide context** about the educational purpose
3. **Reference existing patterns** from our codebase
4. **Specify constraints** like performance or accessibility
5. **Request educational metadata** for new features
6. **Ask for validation** of medical terminology
7. **Seek learning objectives** for new features

## üîç Troubleshooting

If Claude provides solutions that don't align with our educational standards:
1. Clarify educational purpose
2. Reference specific examples from our codebase
3. Mention our documentation standards
4. Highlight educational context requirements
5. Specify target audience (medical students, etc.)

## üéì Educational Quality Assurance

When implementing educational features, ensure Claude:
1. Maintains accurate medical terminology
2. Provides appropriate educational context
3. Follows accessibility guidelines
4. Maintains performance standards
5. Integrates with knowledge services
6. Supports learning objectives
7. Includes clinical relevance

## üåü Advanced Claude Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```
Let's think through implementing the [feature] step by step:
1. First, we need to understand the educational purpose
2. Then, identify the core components needed
3. Next, determine integration points with knowledge services
4. Finally, implement with proper error handling and documentation
```

### Self-Critique Prompting
```
Please review this implementation of [feature] and critique it from
multiple perspectives: educational value, code quality, performance,
accessibility, and medical accuracy.
```

### Educational Enhancement Prompting
```
Please enhance this implementation with additional educational context,
clinical relevance, and learning objective metadata to better serve our
medical student users.
```
