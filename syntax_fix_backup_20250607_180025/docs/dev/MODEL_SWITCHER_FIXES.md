# Model Switcher System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Scene Structure and Hierarchy**
   - Reorganized the main scene (`node_3d.tscn`) with proper hierarchy
   - Created dedicated containers for UI elements under a CanvasLayer
   - Added explicit BrainModel node to contain all 3D models

2. **UI Info Panel Cleanup**
   - Removed incorrectly placed 3D models from the UI info panel
   - Removed duplicate ModelControlPanel from the info panel
   - Fixed connections and made sure the panel is properly integrated

3. **Model Loading and Registration**
   - Improved model loading to properly clean up existing models first
   - Enhanced model registration with the model switcher
   - Created cleaner friendly names for models shown in the UI

4. **Signal Connections**
   - Added safety checks for all signal connections
   - Made sure the ModelControlPanel properly updates when models change visibility
   - Ensured the model switcher responds to UI events

5. **Error Prevention**
   - Added many null checks throughout the code
   - Added safety checks before accessing nodes or resources
   - Improved error reporting and debugging information

## Model Switching System Architecture

The model switching system consists of these key components:

1. **ModelSwitcher (scripts/ModelSwitcher.gd)**
   - Core class managing model visibility state
   - Maintains a dictionary of models and visibility states
   - Provides methods to toggle models and send visibility signals

2. **ModelControlPanel (scenes/model_control_panel.gd & .tscn)**
   - UI panel with toggle buttons for each model
   - Updates in response to model visibility changes
   - Sends signals when user toggles model visibility

3. **MainScene (scenes/node_3d.gd)**
   - Handles the model loading and registration with ModelSwitcher
   - Sets up UI and connects signals between components
   - Responds to user model selection events

## How to Use

1. The model control panel appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen
2. Each loaded model has a checkbox to toggle its visibility
3. The "Show All Models" button makes all models visible
4. Models can be selected with a left mouse click to show information
5. Camera controls: Middle-mouse to rotate, scroll wheel to zoom, arrow keys for movement

## Debugging

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console for detailed logs during model loading
2. Look for "DEBUG:" lines that explain what's happening
3. Make sure all .glb model files are in the correct locations
