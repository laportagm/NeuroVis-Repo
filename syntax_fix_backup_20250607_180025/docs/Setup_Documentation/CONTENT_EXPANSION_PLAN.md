# Content Expansion Plan: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

The long-term value and utility of the AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer heavily depend on the richness, accuracy, and breadth of its educational content. This document outlines the strategy for systematically expanding and updating this content over time. Content includes anatomical information, 3D models, and potentially other multimedia assets.

## 2. Scope of Content for Expansion

Content development will focus on the following areas:

1.  **Anatomical Structures Information (Primary Focus):**
    - **Deepening Existing Entries:** Adding more detail to `detailedDescription`, `alternativeNames`, `functions`, `connections`, and `clinicalNotes` for structures already in the knowledge base.
    - **Adding New Structures:** Incorporating information for additional brain regions, nuclei, tracts, etc., as identifiable in the 3D model(s) or as deemed educationally important.
2.  **3D Models (Secondary Focus - Post-MVP):**
    - **Additional Specialized Models:** Potentially incorporating models of specific brain regions (e.g., detailed hippocampus, brainstem) or models illustrating particular conditions if suitable free/openly-licensed assets become available.
    - **Higher Detail Versions:** Replacing existing models if significantly better and more detailed versions are found (balancing detail with performance).
3.  **Neural Pathway Visualization (Future Feature):**
    - Requires defining pathway data (nodes, tracts) and implementing rendering logic. Content here involves identifying key pathways and their constituent structures from the knowledge base.
4.  **Clinical Correlations & Case Studies (Future Feature):**
    - Linking anatomical structures/pathways to specific clinical conditions, symptoms, and illustrative (anonymized or hypothetical) case snippets. This requires extremely careful sourcing and ethical consideration.
5.  **Supporting Multimedia (Future Feature):**
    - Integrating 2D diagrams, histological images, or short video clips related to selected structures (as hinted by `imagePlaceholder` in the knowledge base schema). Sourcing and licensing are key.

## 3. Process for Adding/Updating Anatomical Information (Knowledge Base)

This is the most frequent type of content update.

1.  **Identification of Need/Opportunity:**
    - Based on gaps in the current knowledge base.
    - Alignment with standard neuroanatomy curricula.
    - User feedback (if a mechanism is implemented later).
    - Availability of distinct, selectable regions in the 3D model.
2.  **Research & Information Curation (CRITICAL):**
    - **Authoritative Sources:** Exclusively use reputable, peer-reviewed neuroanatomy textbooks, scientific journals, and established medical education resources.
    - **AI for Research Assistance:** AI assistants can be used to _find potential sources_ or _summarize information from provided sources_, but **AI-generated factual content must be meticulously verified and rewritten by the developer using the authoritative sources.** AI is a research _assistant_, not the source of truth for medical facts.
    - **Cross-Referencing:** Information for each field (description, functions, etc.) should be verified against at least two reliable sources.
3.  **Data Entry & Formatting:**
    - Manually update the `anatomical_data.json` file according to the defined schema.
    - Ensure consistent terminology and writing style (see Style Guide in `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`).
    - _AI Assist Prompt Example:_ "I have the following information for the 'Thalamus': [paste notes/draft]. Can you help me format this into a JSON object that matches my schema [provide schema snippet if complex]?" (Developer then verifies and refines the AI's formatted output).
4.  **Validation & Review:**
    - Check JSON syntax validity (using a linter or VS Code's built-in checks).
    - Review for accuracy, clarity, and completeness against the curated sources.
    - Test in-app to ensure the new/updated content displays correctly.
5.  **Version Control:**
    - Commit changes to `anatomical_data.json` to Git with clear messages (e.g., "Added detailed description for Hippocampus," "Corrected function list for Cerebellum").

## 4. Process for Adding/Updating 3D Models (Future - Post-MVP)

1.  **Sourcing & Licensing:** Find suitable GLTF models with appropriate free/open licenses.
2.  **Pre-processing (If Necessary):**
    - Use Blender (free, open-source 3D software) or similar tools for:
      - Optimizing poly count (if too high for performance).
      - Ensuring distinct parts are separate, named meshes for selection.
      - Adjusting scale, orientation, or pivot points.
      - Cleaning materials or UV maps.
    - _AI Assist Prompt Example:_ "I have a complex GLTF model. What are some basic steps in Blender a beginner can take to simplify its geometry or separate its parts into named meshes?"
3.  **Integration:**
    - Add the model file to the project's assets.
    - Update the application logic if it needs to load this new model (e.g., a model selection UI would be needed).
    - Crucially, map the new model's selectable mesh IDs/names to corresponding entries in the `anatomical_data.json` knowledge base. New entries in the knowledge base might need to be created.

## 5. Content Prioritization Strategy

1.  **MVP Focus (Initial):** Ensure all initially targeted structures (e.g., 5-10 major brain regions as listed in `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SCHEMA_AND_CONTENT_PLAN.md`) have accurate `displayName`, `shortDescription`, and `functions`.
2.  **Breadth vs. Depth:**
    - Initially, aim for broader coverage of major, commonly taught structures with accurate `shortDescription` and `functions`.
    - Subsequently, deepen the content for these structures by populating `detailedDescription`, `connections`, `clinicalNotes`, etc.
3.  **Alignment with 3D Model:** Prioritize documenting structures that are clearly identifiable and selectable in the primary 3D model.
4.  **Curriculum Relevance:** Consider common neuroanatomy curricula to guide the order of adding structures/details.
5.  **User Feedback (Future):** If users can provide feedback, this can highlight areas where more content or detail is desired.

## 6. Quality Assurance (QA)

- **Self-Review:** Developer meticulously reviews all curated content against original sources.
- **Consistency Checks:** Ensure terminology, formatting, and style are consistent across all entries in the knowledge base.
- **In-App Testing:** Always test how new or updated content appears and functions within the application.
- **Peer Review (Informal):** If possible, have a friend or colleague with some domain knowledge (even general biology) review descriptions for clarity.

## 7. Release Cycle for Content Updates

- Initially, content updates (to `anatomical_data.json`) will be bundled with new minor versions of the application.
- There is no plan for dynamic over-the-air content updates for the MVP to maintain simplicity and offline capability of the core knowledge base.
- Significant content additions would warrant a new version release (e.g., v0.2, v0.3).
