- Verification Process: Briefly outline (e.g., cross-referencing multiple sources).
- Style Guide for Descriptions: Brief notes (e.g., "clear, concise language," "target audience: student/educated layperson," "avoid excessive jargon where possible or explain it").
- Data Storage and Access:
- Initial plan: Bundled JSON file, loaded at runtime.
- Future: Potential for SQLite if data grows very large (note complexity).
- Expansion Plan: How new structures and information will be added over time.

I will generate these with a good level of detail, ensuring clarity. The language will be professional but accessible to a beginner developer. I will also make sure to include placeholders or instructions where the user (developer) needs to fill in specific details or make choices.

Okay, this is a fantastic step to solidify your project's foundation! Creating these detailed documents will be invaluable for your own clarity, for guiding your AI assistants, and for keeping the project on track.

Here are the three documentation files, generated with depth, detail, and clarity, based on our discussions. You can copy the content for each into separate .md files (e.g., USER_STORIES.md).

# User Stories: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the user stories for the AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer. User stories help define the application's functionality from an end-user's perspective, ensuring development is focused on delivering value. They typically follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a benefit/goal]."

These stories will guide the incremental development of features, especially for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent iterations.

## 2. User Personas (Simplified)

To provide context for the user stories, we consider these primary personas:

- **Alex, the Medical Student:** Needs to learn and memorize complex neuroanatomy quickly and accurately for exams and clinical practice. Values intuitive visualization and clear, concise information.
- **Dr. Chen, the Neuroscience Researcher:** Explores specific brain regions and their connections for research purposes. Values accuracy, detail, and the ability to quickly access functional information.
- **Sam, the Curious Learner:** Has a general interest in understanding the brain. Values engaging content and easy-to-understand explanations without overwhelming jargon.

## 3. User Stories for "Must-Have" (MVP) Features

_(These stories correspond to the "Must-Have" features M1-M9 outlined in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and will be tackled incrementally across the initial development phases.)_

---

## **M1: Load and display at least one detailed 3D brain model.**

- **US1.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the application to launch and immediately display a clear, well-rendered 3D model of the human brain so that I can begin exploring without delay.
- **US1.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want to see a visually appealing 3D brain model when I open the application so that I feel engaged and interested to learn more.

---

## **M2: Standard 3D navigation controls (orbit, zoom, pan) via mouse.**

- **US2.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to easily rotate the 3D brain model in any direction using my mouse (e.g., left-click and drag) so that I can examine structures from all angles.
- **US2.2:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want to zoom in and out of the 3D brain model smoothly using my mouse scroll wheel so that I can inspect fine details or get a broader overview.
- **US2.3:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to pan the 3D brain model (move it side-to-side, up-and-down) using my mouse (e.g., right-click/middle-click and drag) so that I can focus the view on different areas of interest.

---

## **M3: Click-to-select distinct anatomical structures within the 3D model.**

- **US3.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want to be able to click on a visible part of the 3D brain model, like the cerebellum, so that the application recognizes I am interested in that specific structure.
- **US3.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want a simple way, like clicking, to indicate to the application which part of the brain I want to learn about.

---

## **M4: Visual highlighting of the selected structure.**

- **US4.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the brain structure I click on to visually change (e.g., change color or glow) so that I have clear, immediate feedback confirming my selection.
- **US4.2:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want the selected structure to be distinctly highlighted so I can easily differentiate it from surrounding structures while I examine it.

---

## **M5: Display basic information (name, short description, key functions) for selected structures from a local data source.**

- **US5.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), when I select a brain structure, I want to immediately see its correct anatomical name displayed clearly so I can learn and verify terminology.
- **US5.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), after selecting a brain part, I want to read a short, easy-to-understand description of what it is so I can grasp its basic identity.
- **US5.3:** As Alex (Medical Student), upon selecting a structure, I want to see a concise list of its key functions so that I can quickly associate the structure with its physiological roles.

---

## **M6: Simple User Interface (UI) for displaying information and potentially AI interaction.**

- **US6.1:** As Sam (Curious Learner), I want the information about a selected brain part to appear in a dedicated, easy-to-read area of the screen so I don't have to search for it.
- **US6.2:** As Alex (Medical Student), I want the UI to be clean and uncluttered so that I can focus on the 3D model and the anatomical information without distractions.

---

## **M7: In-app AI assistant (via online free-tier API) for answering questions and providing dynamic explanations.**

- **US7.1:** As Alex (Medical Student), when a structure is selected, I want to be able to ask the in-app AI assistant a specific question like "What are the main neurotransmitters associated with the hippocampus?" so I can get a targeted answer.
- **US7.2:** As Sam (Curious Learner), after selecting a brain part, I want the AI assistant to offer a slightly more detailed or alternative explanation of its function in simple terms, beyond the basic description.
- **US7.3:** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher), I want to ask the AI assistant clarifying questions about a selected structure's role or known research findings so I can quickly get supplementary information.

---

## **M8 & M9: Cross-platform support (Windows and macOS) & Distributable Installer.**

- **US8.1 (Developer-focused):** As the developer, I want the application to be buildable for both Windows and macOS from my Mac development environment so that a wider audience can use it.

- **US9.2 (User-focused):** As Dr. Chen (Neuroscience Researcher) using a MacBook, I want a simple way to download and install the application (e.g., a DMG file).

## 4. User Stories for "Nice-to-Have" Features (Examples)

- **N1.1:** As Dr. Chen, I want to be able to load a specialized 3D model of a specific brain region (e.g., brainstem) if available, so I can focus my research.
- **N2.1:** As Alex, I want to be able to place temporary labels or pins on the 3D model while studying, so I can mark structures for later review.
- **N3.1:** As a medical student, I want to see major neural pathways (like the corticospinal tract) visualized on the 3D model when I select relevant structures, so I can understand connectivity.
- **N6.1:** As Sam, I want to be able to ask the AI assistant questions using my voice, so the interaction feels more natural.

## 5. Backlog Management Note

This document will serve as an initial backlog. Stories will be prioritized based on the phased development plan. As development progresses, stories might be refined, broken down further, or new ones added based on insights and feedback.

# UI/UX Design Notes: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines initial thoughts, principles, and sketches for the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) of the AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer. The goal is to create an application that is intuitive, engaging, and supports the learning objectives effectively. This document will evolve as the application is developed.

## 2. Overall Design Philosophy

- **Clarity & Simplicity:** The interface should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to understand, minimizing cognitive load so users can focus on learning.
- **Intuitiveness:** Interactions should be predictable and follow common conventions for desktop applications and 3D viewers.
- **Professionalism:** The visual design should be professional and appropriate for an educational tool targeting medical and scientific users, yet accessible to general learners.
- **Responsiveness:** The UI should provide immediate feedback to user actions.
- **Focus on 3D Content:** The 3D brain model is the primary focus; UI elements should support, not obstruct, its exploration.
- **Accessibility (Basic Consideration):** Strive for good contrast and readable fonts from the start.

## 3. Key UI Components & Layout (Initial Ideas - Text Descriptions)

_(These will be refined with actual sketches/wireframes using pen & paper or a digital tool like Figma's free tier as development progresses for each phase)._

- **Main Application Window:**

  - Single, primary window.
  - Resizable, with sensible minimum dimensions.
  - Standard window controls (minimize, maximize, close) native to the OS.
  - Title bar displaying the application name.

- **3D Viewport (Dominant Area):**

  - Occupies the largest portion of the window (e.g., 70-80% of the width/height).
  - Displays the interactive 3D brain model.

- **Information Display Area (Phases 1-2 Initial):**

  - **Option A (Status Bar - for Phase 1 simplicity):** A thin, persistent bar at the bottom or top of the window.
    - Content: "Selected: [Structure Name]"
    - Pros: Minimal, always visible without taking much space.
    - Cons: Limited space for more information later.
  - **Option B (Simple Static Panel - for Phase 2 information):** A small, fixed-position panel in a corner (e.g., top-right or bottom-left overlaying the 3D view slightly, or a very narrow dedicated column).
    - Content: Structure Name (Title), Short Description, Key Functions.
    - Pros: Can hold a bit more text than a status bar.
    - Cons: Needs careful placement not to obstruct the 3D view too much.
  - **Future (Collapsible Sidebar - Phase 3+):** A more robust sidebar (e.g., on the right) that can be shown/hidden. This would house detailed text information, AI chat interface, etc. For now, plan UI so this could be added later without a complete redesign.

- **AI Interaction Area (Phase 3 onwards - integrated with or evolving from Info Panel):**
  - Initially, this might be implicitly part of the information display (e.g., an "Ask AI" button next to a selected structure's info that then shows the AI response in the same panel).
  - Future: Could involve a text input field for questions and a scrolling area for the AI's responses, likely within the aforementioned collapsible sidebar.

## 4. Interaction Flows (Examples for Key MVP Features)

- **Application Launch & Initial View:**

  1.  User launches application (clicks icon/runs executable).
  2.  Main window appears quickly.
  3.  A default 3D brain model is loaded and displayed in the 3D viewport.
  4.  Camera is at a sensible default position/zoom, showing the whole brain.
  5.  Information display area shows "Selected: None" or similar.

- **3D Model Navigation:**

  1.  User moves mouse into the 3D viewport.
  2.  _Orbit:_ User presses and holds Left Mouse Button, drags mouse. Camera orbits around the model's center.
  3.  _Zoom:_ User scrolls Mouse Wheel up/down. Camera zooms in/out towards the model's center.
  4.  _Pan:_ User presses and holds Right Mouse Button (or Middle Mouse Button), drags mouse. Camera view moves side-to-side/up-down.

- **Structure Selection & Highlighting (Phase 1):**

  1.  User moves mouse cursor over a distinct part of the 3D brain model.
  2.  User clicks Left Mouse Button.
  3.  _System Response:_
      - The clicked part of the model visually highlights (e.g., changes color).
      - If another part was previously highlighted, it reverts to its normal appearance.
      - The Information Display Area updates to show the name of the newly selected structure (e.g., "Selected: Cerebellum").

- **Information Retrieval & Display (Static - Phase 2):**

  1.  User selects a structure (as above).
  2.  _System Response:_ The Information Display Area (e.g., simple panel/sidebar) populates with:
      - Structure Name (as a title).
      - A short, curated description.
      - A list of key functions.

- **AI-Driven Explanation/Q&A (Online API - Phase 3):**
  1.  User selects a structure. Basic info from local KB is displayed.
  2.  User clicks an "Ask AI" button or types a question into an input field related to the selection.
  3.  _System Response:_
      - A loading indicator appears.
      - Application sends a prompt (including context of selected structure and user question if any) to the online LLM API.
      - Upon receiving a response, the loading indicator disappears.
      - AI's response is displayed in a designated area (e.g., replacing/augmenting info in the panel, or in a chat-like view).
      - Error message displayed if API call fails (e.g., "AI assistant unavailable, please check internet connection").

## 5. Visual Design Elements (Initial Thoughts)

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary UI Chrome (Window backgrounds, panels):** Neutral grays (e.g., `#333333` to `#555555` for dark mode, or `#F0F0F0` to `#DDEEFF` for light mode - decide on one theme for MVP).
  - **Accent/Highlight Color (for selected 3D objects, important UI elements):** A vibrant but not jarring color that contrasts well with brain model colors (e.g., a bright teal `#00FFFF`, lime green `#32CD32`, or amber `#FFBF00`).
  - **Text Color:** High contrast against backgrounds (e.g., near-white for dark mode, near-black for light mode).
  - **3D Model Colors:** Will depend on the model, but typically naturalistic or segmented with distinct colors. Highlighting should be clearly visible on these.
- **Typography:**
  - **Primary Font:** Clear, legible, sans-serif font. Examples: Open Sans, Lato, Roboto, Inter. Ensure good readability for blocks of text.
  - **Hierarchy:** Use font weight (bold, regular) and size to differentiate titles, subheadings, and body text.
- **Iconography (Minimal for MVP):**
  - If any icons are used (e.g., for a future "settings" or "help" button), they should be simple, universally understood, and stylistically consistent. Consider using a free icon library like Material Symbols or Font Awesome if needed later.

## 6. Usability Principles (Guiding Design)

1.  **Immediate Feedback:** User actions should result in immediate and clear visual feedback.
2.  **Consistency:** Interactions and visual elements should be consistent throughout the application.
3.  **Clarity:** UI elements and information should be unambiguous and easy to understand.
4.  **Efficiency:** Users should be able to achieve their goals with a minimum number of steps/clicks.
5.  **Error Prevention & Forgiveness:** Design to prevent errors. If errors occur (e.g., API failure), provide clear messages.
6.  **Discoverability:** Features should be easy to find or their presence should be intuitive.
7.  **Minimalism:** Avoid clutter. Every element on the screen should serve a clear purpose.

## 7. Accessibility Considerations (Initial - to be expanded)

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, and for UI elements.
- **Font Size & Legibility:** Use readable font sizes. (Consider if font scaling is a future feature).
- **Keyboard Navigation (Future):** While initial focus is mouse, consider later if key UI elements can be navigated via keyboard.

# Knowledge Base Schema & Content Plan: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Project Phase:** Initial Planning & Phase 1 Start
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Introduction

The core educational value of the Brain Anatomy Visualizer relies on accurate, well-structured, and accessible anatomical information. This document defines the schema for storing this information and outlines the plan for curating and managing its content. This knowledge base will initially be a local file bundled with the application.

## 2. Data Format (Initial)

- **Format:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Reasoning:**
  - Human-readable and easy to edit manually for a solo developer.
  - Easily parsed by JavaScript (for Electron/Three.js path) and GDScript (for Godot path).
  - Flexible enough to evolve the schema if needed.
  - No external database dependencies for the MVP.
- **File Name (Example):** `anatomical_data.json` (to be stored in an `assets/data/` folder).

## 3. Detailed JSON Schema Definition

The root of the JSON file will be an array of objects, where each object represents a distinct anatomical structure.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "String", // REQUIRED. Unique identifier for the structure. MUST match the name/ID of the corresponding mesh(es) in the 3D model(s) for selection linking. E.g., "FrontalLobe_Mesh", "Cerebellum_Main".
    "displayName": "String", // REQUIRED. The common, human-readable name for display in the UI. E.g., "Frontal Lobe".
    "alternativeNames": ["String"], // OPTIONAL. Array of synonyms or alternative nomenclatures. E.g., ["Lobus frontalis"].
    "shortDescription": "String", // REQUIRED for MVP. A concise summary (1-3 sentences) suitable for initial display.
    "detailedDescription": "String", // OPTIONAL for MVP, for future expansion. A more in-depth explanation, potentially with multiple paragraphs or sections (Markdown could be used here if the UI will support rendering it).
    "functions": ["String"], // REQUIRED for MVP. An array of strings, each describing a key function. E.g., ["Higher-level cognitive processes", "Planning and decision-making", "Voluntary movement control"].
    "connections": [ // OPTIONAL for MVP, for future pathway visualization.
      {
        "connectedStructureId": "String", // ID of another structure in this knowledge base.
        "pathwayName": "String", // Optional: Name of the specific neural tract or connection type.
        "description": "String" // Optional: Brief description of this connection's role.
      }
    ],
    "clinicalNotes": "String", // OPTIONAL for MVP, for future expansion. Brief notes on clinical relevance, common pathologies, or effects of damage. (Markdown could be used here).
    "imagePlaceholder": "String" // OPTIONAL. Placeholder for a future feature to show a 2D image/diagram of the structure. E.g., "path/to/frontal_lobe_diagram.png".
  }
  // ... more structure objects
]
Field Explanations:

id: Crucial for linking the data to the 3D model parts. Must be consistent.
displayName: What the user sees as the title.
alternativeNames: Useful for search functionality later.
shortDescription: The first piece of textual info the user sees. Keep it brief.
detailedDescription: For deeper dives. Allows for more comprehensive info.
functions: Bullet-point style list of primary roles.
connections: Structured way to define relationships for future pathway visualization.
clinicalNotes: Adds practical relevance for medical users.
imagePlaceholder: For future multimedia integration.
