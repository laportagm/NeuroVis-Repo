# Project Brief: AI-Enhanced Brain Anatomy Visualizer (Desktop)

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Developer:** Solo Developer (AI-Assisted)
**Location:** Ardmore, Pennsylvania, United States

## 1. Vision Statement

To create an advanced, interactive, and intuitive desktop educational tool that enhances learning and understanding of neuroanatomy through intelligent interaction with 3D brain models, supported by an AI assistant for dynamic explanations and Q&A. The application aims to be freely accessible to users.

## 2. Target Audience

- Medical Students
- Neuroscience Researchers & Students
- Healthcare Professionals seeking to refresh or expand their neuroanatomical knowledge.
- Individuals with a keen interest in learning about brain anatomy.

## 3. Core Problem / Need Addressed

Traditional methods of learning neuroanatomy (textbooks, static 2D images, non-interactive models) can be challenging for developing a comprehensive 3D spatial understanding and grasping functional relationships. This application aims to bridge that gap by providing an immersive, interactive, and intelligently guided learning experience.

## 4. Key Goals & Objectives

- **Develop an engaging 3D visualization platform:** Allow users to explore detailed 3D brain models intuitively.
- **Facilitate understanding of anatomical structures:** Enable easy identification, selection, and information retrieval for brain components.
- **Promote learning of functional neuroanatomy:** Provide explanations of neurological pathways, interconnections, and functions.
- **Offer AI-driven assistance:** Incorporate an AI agent to answer questions and provide contextual information.
- **Ensure accessibility:** Provide the application free of charge to end-users.
- **Maintain low development effort and solo maintainability:** Focus on technologies and processes suitable for a solo developer with AI assistance.

## 5. High-Level Feature List

### Must-Haves (for initial usable versions, building incrementally):

- **M1:** Load and display at least one detailed 3D brain model.
- **M2:** Standard 3D navigation controls (orbit, zoom, pan) via mouse.
- **M3:** Click-to-select distinct anatomical structures within the 3D model.
- **M4:** Visual highlighting of the selected structure.
- **M5:** Display basic information (name, short description, key functions) for selected structures from a local data source.
- **M6:** Simple User Interface (UI) for displaying information and potentially AI interaction.
- **M7:** In-app AI assistant (via online free-tier API) for:
  - Answering user questions about selected structures or general neuroanatomy.
  - Providing dynamic explanations for selected structures.
- **M8:** Cross-platform support (Windows and macOS).
- **M9:** Application distributable as a downloadable installer.

### Nice-to-Haves (Post-MVP enhancements):

- **N1:** Loading multiple different brain models or datasets.
- **N2:** More advanced labeling and annotation tools.
- **N3:** Visualization of neural pathways on the 3D model.
- **N4:** More sophisticated UI/UX for information presentation.
- **N5:** Text input for searching structures or asking questions.
- **N6:** Voice command integration (using OS capabilities or libraries if feasible and low-cost).
- **N7:** Basic user-side customization (e.g., visual settings).
- **N8:** Offline fallback for core information display if AI API is unavailable.

### Future Considerations (Long-term vision):

- **F1:** Clinical case correlations and real-world implications of brain injuries.
- **F2:** Adaptive, progressive learning modules based on user behavior (requires more complex AI and data).
- **F3:** Integration of locally running small AI models (if performance and setup become feasible for a solo developer).
- **F4:** User accounts for saving progress or annotations (adds complexity and potential cost).
- **F5:** Community features or content sharing (adds significant complexity).

## 6. Project Boundaries (What this application will NOT initially do for MVP/early versions):

- **Not a diagnostic tool:** Purely educational.
- **No user data storage/accounts:** To maintain simplicity and no cost.
- **No advanced medical imaging (DICOM) support:** Focus on pre-processed 3D models.
- **No real-time physiological data display.**
- **No complex, locally-run AI models in initial versions:** Due to complexity and resource requirements for a solo beginner developer. AI features will rely on online APIs with free tiers.
- **Not attempt to teach surgical procedures or clinical decision-making directly.**

## 7. Success Metrics (for initial versions):

- User can successfully install and run the application on Windows and macOS.
- User can load and interact with the 3D brain model smoothly.
- User can select predefined structures and view accurate basic information.
- User can ask simple questions to the in-app AI assistant (via API) and receive relevant answers.
- Positive qualitative feedback from any early testers regarding ease of use and learning value for the implemented features.
- Developer (you) gains significant experience in desktop application development and AI integration.
